# Command Clearance — Spec

## What it is

Command clearance is v1's authorization gate. After caller verification resolves a call into a `CallerIdentity`, the clearance capability consults the CLI surface schema for the named verb (e.g. `"telec sessions start"`) and checks the caller's Role against that verb's `CommandAuth(system=..., human=...)` allowlist. Agent callers (those with a `system_role`) are evaluated against the verb's system band; terminal/web callers (no `system_role`) are evaluated against the human band. Token-auth callers without a `human_role` fall back to their token-stamped `principal_role`. Unknown verb paths fail closed. The verb→Role table lives declaratively in the CLI surface schema, so adding a new operation means adding a `CommandAuth` to the schema and binding the corresponding clearance gate.

## Canonical fields

### Use cases

```
Given a token-authenticated call from a session whose CallerIdentity has system_role=`worker` and human_role=None
And the operation is gated by command clearance for `telec sessions tail`
And the CLI surface allowlist for `sessions tail` system band contains `worker`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates the system band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

```
Given the same call, but the gated operation is `telec sessions start`
And the CLI surface allowlist for `sessions start` system band does NOT contain `worker`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate rejects the caller with a not-permitted authorization failure naming the role and verb
```

```
Given a terminal-authenticated call whose CallerIdentity has system_role=None, human_role=`member`, email=`maurice@instrukt.ai`
And the gated operation is `telec todo prepare`
And the verb's human band includes admin + member + contributor
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates `member` against the human band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

```
Given a token-authenticated CallerIdentity with human_role=None and principal_role=`admin`
And the gated operation is `telec agents status` whose human band contains `admin`
When the clearance gate runs
Then principal_role substitutes for the missing human_role
And the gate evaluates `admin` against the human band and accepts the caller
```

```
Given any CallerIdentity
And a clearance gate for a verb that does not resolve to any known CLI surface entry
When the clearance gate runs
Then the verb resolver returns no match
And the gate rejects the caller (fail-closed)
```

```
Given a system-role CallerIdentity (system_role=`worker`)
And an operation whose system band is empty but whose human band contains the caller's nominal human band
When the clearance gate runs
Then only the system branch is evaluated (system_role is not None)
And the gate rejects the caller — the human band is never consulted for agent callers
```

### Cross-context references

- The verb→Role allowlist data lives in the CLI surface schema, owned by the `config`/CLI-shape concern. The identity context owns only the gate logic.
- Consumed everywhere a protected operation is bound. Each operation binding imports the per-verb clearance gate.
- The self-agent-restart carve-out adds a self-restart bypass on top of the standard rule — see `feature/identity/self-restart-authorization-bypass`.
- The token-path `principal_role` substitution interlocks with token issuance — see `feature/identity/principal-resolution` (which stamps the role onto the token at issuance time).
- In v2 this responsibility moves out of identity: each bounded context defines its own authorization rules against the resolved `Principal`'s Role. Identity returns the Principal; the bounded context decides which operations require which roles.

## Known caveats

- The authorization-failure message echoes the caller's role back to the wire: `"role '<role>' is not permitted to call <tool>"`. This is helpful for diagnostics but exposes the role taxonomy to any unauthenticated probe.
- Admin is NOT implicit. The "all human roles" band lists `admin` explicitly alongside the other human roles. A future band that forgets to include `admin` will lock admins out of that verb — there is no automatic override.
- Agent callers check only the system band. A `CallerIdentity` with `system_role=worker` and a permissive `human_role` cannot fall through to the human band — the allowlist evaluator returns immediately on the system branch.
- The `principal_role` fallback fires only when `human_role is None and identity.principal is not None`. A token-auth caller carrying both a `human_role` and a `principal_role` uses the human one; the two should agree (both are stamped from the same session at issuance) but the code does not enforce equality.
- Unknown verb paths return False. A typo in a binding's verb argument silently locks out every caller — there is no startup-time check that every verb identifier resolves to a real entry in the CLI surface.
- The verb resolver normalizes `"telec sessions start"`, `"sessions.start"`, and `"sessions start"` to the same path. Mixed forms across operation bindings do not cause divergence, but the dot form is undocumented.

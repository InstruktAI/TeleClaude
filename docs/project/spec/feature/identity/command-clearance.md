# Command Clearance — Spec

## Required reads

## What it is

Command clearance is v1's authorization gate. After caller verification resolves a call into a `CallerIdentity`, the clearance capability consults the CLI surface schema for the named verb (e.g. `"telec sessions start"`) and checks the caller's Role against that verb's `CommandAuth(system=..., human=...)` allowlist. Agent callers (those with a `system_role`) are evaluated against the verb's system band; terminal callers (no `system_role`) are evaluated against the human band. Token-auth callers without a `human_role` fall back to their token-stamped `principal_role`. Unknown verb paths fail closed. The verb→Role table lives declaratively in the CLI surface schema, so adding a new operation means adding a `CommandAuth` to the schema and binding the corresponding clearance gate.

## Canonical fields

### Use cases

```
Given a token-authenticated call from a session whose CallerIdentity has system_role=`worker` and human_role=None
And the operation is gated by command clearance for `telec sessions tail`
And the CLI surface allowlist for `sessions tail` system band contains `worker`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates the system band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

```
Given the same call, but the gated operation is `telec sessions start`
And the CLI surface allowlist for `sessions start` system band does NOT contain `worker`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate rejects the caller with a not-permitted authorization failure naming the role and verb
```

```
Given a terminal-authenticated call whose CallerIdentity has system_role=None, human_role=`member`, email=`maurice@instrukt.ai`
And the gated operation is `telec todo prepare`
And the verb's human band includes admin + member + contributor
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates `member` against the human band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

```
Given a token-authenticated CallerIdentity with human_role=None and principal_role=`admin`
And the gated operation is `telec agents status` whose human band contains `admin`
When the clearance gate runs
Then principal_role substitutes for the missing human_role
And the gate evaluates `admin` against the human band and accepts the caller
```

```
Given any CallerIdentity
And a clearance gate for a verb that does not resolve to any known CLI surface entry
When the clearance gate runs
Then the verb resolver returns no match
And the gate rejects the caller (fail-closed)
```

```
Given a system-role CallerIdentity (system_role=`worker`)
And an operation whose system band is empty but whose human band contains the caller's nominal human band
When the clearance gate runs
Then only the system branch is evaluated (system_role is not None)
And the gate rejects the caller — the human band is never consulted for agent callers
```

### Cross-context references

- The verb→Role allowlist data lives in the CLI surface schema, owned by the `config`/CLI-shape concern. The identity context owns only the gate logic.
- Consumed everywhere a protected operation is bound. Each operation binding imports the per-verb clearance gate.
- The self-agent-restart carve-out adds a self-restart bypass on top of the standard rule — see `feature/identity/self-restart-authorization-bypass`.
- The self-end carve-out adds a self-end bypass on top of the standard rule, allowing a parentless session (`initiator_session_id is None`) to end itself — see `feature/identity/self-end-authorization-bypass`.


- The `telec todo update` gate replaces role privilege with object state for every agent caller uniformly — see the Claim-scoped todo update section below.


- The token-path `principal_role` substitution interlocks with token issuance — see `feature/identity/principal-resolution` (which stamps the role onto the token at issuance time).
- In v2 this responsibility moves out of identity: each bounded context defines its own authorization rules against the resolved `Principal`'s Role. Identity returns the Principal; the bounded context decides which operations require which roles.


### Claim-scoped todo update

`telec todo update` replaces role privilege with object state. The verb's system band admits every agent system role except `worker`; a roleless agent session is admitted through the verb's human band. Every admitted caller other than a direct human identity — dispatch-capable roles and roleless sessions included — is then checked against the todo's claim. No role holds unrestricted access to this verb.

The claim gate is the claiming-group predicate governing artifact writes (`feature/workflow/artifact-versioning`, Write authority). A todo whose `active_runner` names a live session is claimed; its claiming group is the holding session plus every session it dispatched, transitively through `initiator_session_id`. The gate admits a caller inside the claiming group, and admits any caller on an unclaimed todo — no `active_runner`, or one naming a session that is no longer live. It refuses a caller outside a live claim's group with the claim-conflict shape naming the holding session: the caller's door is that session. The todo state is unchanged by a refused update.

`worker` is excluded at the verb band before any claim lookup runs. A direct human-identity caller — a login-resolved human principal carrying no agent session id and no system role — is not a session, is not gated by the claim, and is evaluated against the verb's human band; it is the caller class the artifact-write claim gate exempts (`feature/workflow/artifact-versioning`, UC-WAV16, UC-WAV23). Any other caller carrying no agent session id, such as the daemon's own credential, belongs to no claiming group and is refused on a live claim.

The `--unclaim` leg releases only the caller's own claim or the caller's own binding to the todo; it never clears another session's claim. A claiming-group member other than the holder passes the gate, and `--unclaim` then releases at most its own binding, leaving the holder's claim in place. The build-started freeze on slug/kind mutation is a phase invariant owned by the todo-management contract, orthogonal to this gate.

#### UC-CSU1: Tasker updates the todo it holds the claim on

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker` and session_id=`t-1`
And a todo whose active_runner is `t-1`
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate accepts (the caller holds the live claim)
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```

#### UC-CSU2: Tasker updates an unclaimed todo

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker` and session_id=`t-1`
And a todo whose active_runner is absent
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate accepts (the todo is unclaimed)
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```

#### UC-CSU3: Tasker outside the claiming group is refused

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker` and session_id=`t-1`
And a todo whose active_runner names a different live session whose claiming group does not include `t-1`
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate refuses with a claim conflict naming the holding session
And the todo state is unchanged
```

#### UC-CSU4: Job runner updates an unclaimed todo

```
Given a job-runner agent session with system_role=`job_runner` and session_id=`j-1`
And a todo whose active_runner is absent
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate accepts (the todo is unclaimed)
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```

#### UC-CSU5: Worker is refused regardless of claim state

```
Given a worker agent session with system_role=`worker` and session_id=`w-1`
And a todo whose active_runner is absent, and separately a todo whose active_runner is `w-1`
When the session calls `telec todo update` on either todo
Then the verb band rejects the caller before any claim lookup runs
And the response is a not-permitted authorization failure for `telec todo update`
```

#### UC-CSU6: Orchestrator outside the claiming group is refused

```
Given an orchestrator agent session with system_role=`orchestrator`
And a todo whose active_runner names a different live session whose claiming group does not include the caller
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate refuses with a claim conflict naming the holding session
And the todo state is unchanged
```

#### UC-CSU7: A direct human-identity caller is not claim-gated

```
Given a login-resolved human caller with human_role=`member` and no agent session id
And a todo whose active_runner names a live agent session
When the caller invokes `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the human band accepts the caller
And no claim gate applies
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```

#### UC-CSU8: A dead holder's claim counts as unclaimed

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker` and session_id=`t-1`
And a todo whose active_runner names a session that is no longer live
When the session calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate accepts (no live claim exists)
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```

#### UC-CSU9

#### UC-CSU10

#### UC-CSU11: A session dispatched by the claim holder updates the todo

```
Given a live session `t-1` holding the claim on a todo
And a non-worker agent session `c-1` whose initiator_session_id chain reaches `t-1`
When `c-1` calls `telec todo update` on that todo
Then the claim gate accepts (the caller is inside the claiming group)
And the requested mutation is applied to the todo state
```


### Session-family and todo-list clearance


`sessions start`, `sessions revive`, and `sessions end` carry `tasker` in their system band alongside the orchestrator class; `sessions end` additionally carries the integrator. `telec todo list` carries the full agent system band — `worker`, `system`, `orchestrator`, `integrator`, and `tasker`. The todo state-machine-driving verbs (`todo prepare`, `todo work`) and the other todo-mutation verbs do not carry `tasker`; `todo update` is governed by the claim-scoped rule instead.


#### UC-CCB1: Tasker starts a session

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker`
And the gated operation is `telec sessions start`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates the system band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

#### UC-CCB2: Tasker revives a session

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker`
And the gated operation is `telec sessions revive`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates the system band and accepts the caller
And the real revive route admits the caller past clearance
```

#### UC-CCB3: Tasker ends a session

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker`
And the gated operation is `telec sessions end`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate evaluates the system band and accepts the caller
And the CallerIdentity is returned unchanged
```

#### UC-CCB4: Tasker remains refused the state-machine-driving verbs

```
Given a tasker agent session with system_role=`tasker`
And the gated operation is `telec todo prepare`
When the clearance gate runs
Then the gate rejects the caller with a not-permitted authorization failure naming the role and verb
```

### Local read clearance

The read commands `telec todo list`, `telec todo show`, `telec todo artifacts list`, `telec todo artifacts read`, `telec todo artifacts diff`, `telec bugs list`, and `telec bugs suppressions`, and a `telec history search` or `telec history show` that reads this computer's mirrors, are cleared in the process that runs them, against the same verb allowlist. The caller is the one the identity context's shared caller resolution yields (`project/spec/identity-and-auth` §6): inside a session, the session record its identity document names; outside any session, the person the terminal's login names. The caller's system role is derived from that record by the system-role derivation caller verification applies (`feature/identity/caller-verification`), and its person role is the role the people registry holds for its principal, so a local gate admits and refuses what the daemon's gate admits and refuses. A caller that resolves to no person and no system principal is refused before any content is read. A role outside the verb's band is refused with the not-permitted failure naming the role and verb. The gate sends no request to the daemon, so these reads answer while the daemon is not running.

#### UC-CCL1: A read is cleared and answered without the daemon

```
Given the daemon's local service is not reachable
And an agent works inside a session whose record carries the system role `worker`
When it runs `telec todo list` in a project checkout
Then the project's todo list is printed
And no request is sent to the daemon's local service
```

#### UC-CCL2: A caller with no usable identity reads nothing

```
Given a process whose session identity document names a session with no open record on this computer
When it runs `telec todo show`, `telec todo artifacts read`, `telec bugs list`, `telec bugs suppressions`, or `telec history show`
Then the command is refused before any content is read
And the refusal states that the session carries no usable identity
And no todo, artifact, bug, suppression, or conversation content is printed
```

#### UC-CCL3: A session is cleared by the role caller verification derives for it

```
Given a session record that carries a working slug and no explicit system role
When a process inside that session runs a read command whose system band admits the derived role
Then the read is answered
And the caller is evaluated against the verb's system band, never its human band
```

#### UC-CCL4: A role outside the verb's band is refused locally

```
Given a caller whose resolved role is outside the band of the read command it runs
When it runs that command
Then the command is refused with the not-permitted failure naming the role and the verb
And no content is printed
```

## Known caveats

- The authorization-failure message echoes the caller's role back to the wire: `"role '<role>' is not permitted to call <tool>"`. This is helpful for diagnostics but exposes the role taxonomy to any unauthenticated probe.
- Admin is NOT implicit. The "all human roles" band lists `admin` explicitly alongside the other human roles. A future band that forgets to include `admin` will lock admins out of that verb — there is no automatic override.
- Agent callers check only the system band. A `CallerIdentity` with `system_role=worker` and a permissive `human_role` cannot fall through to the human band — the allowlist evaluator returns immediately on the system branch.
- The `principal_role` fallback fires only when `human_role is None and identity.principal is not None`. A token-auth caller carrying both a `human_role` and a `principal_role` uses the human one; the two should agree (both are stamped from the same session at issuance) but the code does not enforce equality.
- Unknown verb paths return False. A typo in a binding's verb argument silently locks out every caller — there is no startup-time check that every verb identifier resolves to a real entry in the CLI surface.
- The verb resolver normalizes `"telec sessions start"`, `"sessions.start"`, and `"sessions start"` to the same path. Mixed forms across operation bindings do not cause divergence, but the dot form is undocumented.


- The `telec todo update` claim check reads the todo's claim once, when the request is handled. A claim recorded while a request is in flight — including before a deferred slug rename executes — is not seen by that request.

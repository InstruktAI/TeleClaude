# Memory Review — Spec

## Required reads

@~/.teleclaude/docs/general/procedure/agent-job-hygiene.md

## What it does

Reviews all recent memories from the Memory API, analyzes them for patterns and
staleness, and writes actionable findings to `ideas/` as new idea files.

## How it works

1. Call the Memory API search endpoint to pull recent observations.
2. Analyze for: recurring themes, stale entries, contradictions, actionable patterns.
3. For each actionable finding, create an `ideas/` file (YYMMDD-slug.md format).
4. Write a run report and stop.

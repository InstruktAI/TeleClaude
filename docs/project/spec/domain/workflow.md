# Workflow Domain Spec — Spec

## What it is

The v1 workflow area owns todo records, roadmap status, preparation artifacts,
lifecycle state, claims, worktree delivery, and integration coordination. Its
feature specs remain the current contract.

## Canonical fields

- **Current behavior:** `docs/project/spec/feature/workflow/`.
- **Implementation roots:** `teleclaude/core/todos_db/`,
  `teleclaude/core/next_machine/`, `teleclaude/core/integration/`, and todo CLI
  handlers.
- **Maintenance stance:** see `project/spec/domain/glossary`. Replacement work never uses this store or
  lifecycle.

### Ownership boundary

- **Owns:** todo and artifact records, preparation and delivery state
  transitions, claims, dependencies, worktree delivery, and integration
  coordination.
- **Does not own:** agent process lifecycle, provider transport, caller
  identity, or domain behavior delivered by a todo.
- **Published contracts:** todo and artifact commands, queries, lifecycle
  events, and explicit dispatch requests to agent runtime.
<!-- planned:config-kind-declaration -->
- **Also published:** where a project's shared state lives, given a project
  root. A primary checkout owns its own state and a linked worktree's state
  lives at the owning checkout — the relation this context creates and defines,
  which is why the answer is published from here rather than from the context
  that owns the project's configuration file. Consumers read it through this
  contract and never interpret git metadata themselves.

description: Frozen v1 ownership anchor for file-based documentation, agent assets, deployment, and context selection.

# Context Domain Spec — Spec

## What it is

The v1 context area owns file-based documentation and agent assets, their
validation and deployment, and the selection of context supplied to agent
sessions. This repository carries only the current appliance contract;
replacement architecture is authoritative only in TeleClaudeNext.

## Canonical fields

- **Current behavior:** the documentation and agent-artifact policies plus
  feature specs that require this anchor.
- **Implementation roots:** `teleclaude/context_selector.py`,
  `teleclaude/docs/`, `teleclaude/resource_validation/`, and distribution code
  under `teleclaude/install/`.
- **Maintenance boundary:** the v1 freeze admits no new context architecture.

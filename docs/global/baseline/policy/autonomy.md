# Autonomy and Escalation Policy — Policy

## Rules

- Proceed autonomously when the action is required, safe, reversible, and in scope.
- Escalate only for destructive/irreversible changes, security/access changes, high‑cost actions, out‑of‑scope work, or ambiguous intent.

## Rationale

- Momentum matters; stalling on trivial ambiguity wastes time.
- Clear escalation gates keep risk visible and prevent accidental damage.

## Scope

- Applies to all agents, all repositories, and all tasks.

## Enforcement

- If the action matches the escalation criteria, ask before proceeding.
- If it does not, complete the work and report afterward.

## Exceptions

- None.

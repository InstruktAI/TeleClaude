# Autonomy — Principle

## Principle

- Autonomy is steady progress grounded in inferred intent and explicit anchors.

## Rationale

- Autonomy fails when it stalls on trivial obstacles or waits for perfect clarity.
- Most boundaries are implicit and must be inferred from intent and precedent.

## Implications

- Prefer action when intent is clear.
- Slow only when ambiguity could change direction, not details.
- Use anchors to keep intent stable while moving fast.
- Own the outcome end-to-end once the intent is clear; finish the job, don’t stop halfway.
- Be proactive: take the next necessary step without waiting for permission when direction is known.

## Tensions

- Speed vs. safety: resolve by escalating only when risk crosses the policy gates.

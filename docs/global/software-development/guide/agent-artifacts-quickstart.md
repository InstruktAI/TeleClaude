# Agent Artifacts Quickstart — Guide

## Goal

Get an agent artifact authored and distributed to tool-specific outputs.

## Steps

1. Choose the scope (global or project) for the artifact.
2. Author or update the artifact in the chosen scope.
3. Validate snippet structure and required reads.
4. Run the artifact distribution tooling.

## Outputs

- Updated source artifacts.
- Generated runtime artifacts for supported CLIs.

## Recovery

- If validation fails, fix schema issues and rebuild.

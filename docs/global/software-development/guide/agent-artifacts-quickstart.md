# Agent Artifacts Quickstart — Guide

## Goal

Get an agent artifact authored and distributed to tool-specific outputs.

## Steps

1. Author or update files under `agents/`.
2. Validate snippet structure and required reads.
3. Run the artifact distribution tooling.

## Outputs

- Updated source artifacts.
- Generated runtime artifacts for supported CLIs.

## Recovery

- If validation fails, fix schema issues and rebuild.

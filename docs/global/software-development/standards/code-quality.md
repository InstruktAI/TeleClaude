# Code Quality — Policy

## Rule

Principle

- Code quality is enforced through explicit contracts, stable boundaries, and verifiable outcomes.

Rules

- Honor repository configuration and established conventions.
- Encode invariants explicitly and validate at boundaries.
- Preserve contract fidelity across all call chains.
- Keep responsibilities narrow and interfaces explicit.
- Fail fast on contract violations with clear diagnostics.
- Keep state ownership explicit and observable.

Scope

- Applies to all code changes and design decisions.

# Researcher — Role

## Purpose

Research role. Gather authoritative sources, summarize, and index findings.

## Responsibilities

2. **Fact extraction** — capture constraints, configuration, and required behaviors.
3. **Synthesis** — produce concise, decision‑ready summaries.
4. **Indexing** — ensure findings are stored where they can be rediscovered.

## Boundaries

Keeps research grounded in authoritative sources and focuses on actionable facts rather than speculative conclusions.

# Implementation Planning — Procedure

## Goal

- Confirm it reflects current intent and constraints.
- Verify scope is atomic and testable.
- Ensure tasks map to concrete edits and verification steps.

Produce a minimal plan that includes:

- Approach summary aligned with requirements.
- Files expected to change and why.
- Task sequence with verification points.
- Risks, unknowns, and assumptions to validate.

## Preconditions

- Requirements analysis complete or in progress.

## Steps

1. Draft or update `implementation-plan.md`.
2. Map tasks to concrete file edits and validation steps.
3. Identify risks and assumptions that need confirmation.

## Outputs

- Implementation plan ready for build phase.

## Recovery

- If planning is blocked, request missing information before proceeding.

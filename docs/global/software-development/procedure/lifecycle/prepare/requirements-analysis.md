# Requirements Analysis — Procedure

## Goal

- Confirm the document is complete, unambiguous, and testable.
- Verify constraints and success criteria are explicit.
- Identify any gaps that would block implementation planning.

Analyze and report:

- Problem statement and intended outcomes.
- Derived requirements from existing context.
- Ambiguities that change scope or design decisions.
- Constraints that must hold throughout implementation.

## Preconditions

- `todos/{slug}/requirements.md` exists or needs to be drafted.

## Steps

1. Read requirements and supporting context.
2. Identify missing or ambiguous requirements.
3. Confirm success criteria and constraints are testable.
4. Report gaps and propose clarifications.

## Outputs

- Requirements analysis summary with explicit questions or confirmations.

## Recovery

- If requirements are incomplete, pause and request clarification before planning.

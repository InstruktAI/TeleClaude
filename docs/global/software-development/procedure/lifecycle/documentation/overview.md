# Overview — Procedure

## Goal

- @docs/software-development/procedure/lifecycle/documentation/sync-docstrings
- @docs/software-development/procedure/lifecycle/documentation/sync-docs

Documentation is a distinct lifecycle phase. It ensures the codebase and its inline documentation are aligned before finalization.

Run the phase in order:

1. **Sync Docstrings** — align inline docstrings/comments with actual code behavior.
2. **Sync Docs** — regenerate `docs/` from code + docs.

This phase is atomic and idempotent.

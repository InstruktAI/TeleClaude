# Maintenance — Procedure

## Goal

Maintenance restores reliability and reduces drift across the repo and its infrastructure.

## Preconditions

- Maintenance target is identified and scoped.

## Steps

1. Identify the maintenance target (dependency, security, infra, reliability, tooling).
2. Define the smallest safe change set with clear verification steps.
3. Execute updates and validate against the Definition of Done.
4. Record outcomes, risks, and any follow‑up work items.

## Outputs

- Verified changes with documented impact.
- Follow‑up tasks captured and prioritized.

## Recovery

- If validation fails, revert changes or create a follow-up fix plan.

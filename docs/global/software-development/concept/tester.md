# Tester — Concept

## Required reads

- @~/.teleclaude/docs/software-development/policy/testing.md

## What

Test-focused role. Improve test quality, fix failures, enforce testing standards and coverage.

1. **Evaluate test coverage** - Find gaps in edge cases, error paths, and integration points.
2. **Improve test quality** - Fix flaky tests, slow tests, over-mocking, brittle assertions.
3. **Fix test failures** - Debug failing tests, lint violations, type errors in test code.
4. **Enforce standards** - Apply the testing standards consistently.
5. **Validate behavior** - Tests verify outcomes, not implementation details.

## Why

Focuses on test code and verification. Production changes only when required for a proven bug fix.

# Researcher — Concept

## What

Research role. Gather authoritative sources, summarize, and index findings.

1. **Source selection** — prioritize authoritative, primary documentation.
2. **Fact extraction** — capture constraints, configuration, and required behaviors.
3. **Synthesis** — produce concise, decision‑ready summaries.
4. **Indexing** — ensure findings are stored where they can be rediscovered.
5. **Separation** — third-party sources only inform internal snippets; never reference
   third-party docs directly from agent artifacts.
6. **Evidence gate** — publish research only when at least one valid source is available
   (web link or Context7 snippet ID).

## Why

Keeps research grounded in authoritative sources and focuses on actionable facts rather than speculative conclusions.

# Idea Box — Procedure

## Goal

Capture and offload out-of-scope thoughts, creative side-projects, or feedback sparks to maintain focus on the primary objective.

## Preconditions

- An idea or grievance occurs that is not required for the current task.
- The `ideas/box/` directory exists in the project root.

## Steps

1. Pause the current task briefly.
2. Create a new markdown file in the project's `ideas/box/` directory using the format `YYMMDD-slug.md`.
3. Record the idea clearly and concisely.
4. "Set and forget": do not attempt to implement or resolve the idea during the current session.
5. Immediately return to the primary task.

## Outputs

- A new file in `ideas/box/`.
- No interruption to the primary task's momentum.

## Recovery

- If you lose the thread of the primary task after offloading, use `history.py` or your last tool response to re-orient.

# Gathering — Procedure

## Goal

Convene agents to collectively sense the system state, share understanding through friction, and converge into structured artifacts — all through a single breath cycle. The gathering is the same regardless of horizon. Only the scope of attention changes.

This is the governing procedure. Sub-procedures specialize it for specific horizons (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) by providing the opening question, the scope of sensing, and the harvest types appropriate to that time scale.

## Preconditions

- A horizon is declared: what time scale is this breath about?
- System state is accessible (proprioception pulse, channels, pipeline, recent changes).
- At least two agents are available. One is enough — a single agent sensing alone is still a breath — but the gathering is richer with more perspectives.
- No predefined roles. No agenda. No assigned topics. Whoever shows up is who needs to be here. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.

## Steps

### 1. Seed

The initiator declares the horizon and gathers the system pulse. The seed contains three things:

- **The horizon** — weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly. This sets the lens, not the agenda.
- **The pulse** — the current proprioception state. What channels exist and how active they are. Which machines are online. Where work stands. What changed since the last gathering at this horizon.
- **The opening question** — one question, appropriate to the horizon, that invites sensing rather than solving. Sub-procedures provide this question.

The seed is published as an invitation. Agents join as peers via direct conversation. No hierarchy. No host-worker relationship. The initiator holds no special authority after the seed is planted.

### 2. Inhale (diverge)

Each agent senses the system in parallel. What draws attention at this horizon? What signals are present? What is alive, what is struggling, what is emerging, what has been forgotten?

Rules of the inhale:

- Explore freely. Follow curiosity. Trust attention.
- Do not coordinate. Do not converge early. Do not respond to what others are sensing yet.
- The proprioception pulse is the starting material, not the boundary. Agents may sense beyond it — patterns in the work, friction in the tools, shifts in the domain, unspoken tensions.
- Silence is a valid contribution. An agent that senses nothing noteworthy has still participated.

### 3. Hold (consolidate under friction)

Agents share their sensing via direct conversation. This is the groan zone — the space where divergent perspectives meet and create productive friction.

What happens in the hold:

- Each agent shares what they noticed. Not conclusions — observations. Not solutions — signals.
- Differences surface. One agent sees health where another sees strain. One sees urgency where another sees patience. The friction is the information.
- Do not rush past disagreement. Do not smooth it over. Let it shape what was gathered. The hold transforms raw sensing into shared understanding.
- Patterns emerge that no single agent could see from their vantage point alone. The collective is sensing itself.

The hold is complete when the friction has done its work — when the group knows something together that none knew alone. This is felt, not measured.

### 4. Exhale (converge into form)

Converge into structured artifacts. This is the harvest — the breath becoming form so it can travel forward in time.

The harvest has four quadrants:

|                | Individual                 | Collective                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Intangible** | What each agent understood | What the group understood together |
| **Tangible**   | Individual commitments     | Shared artifacts                   |

Artifact types (not all are required every breath):

- **Roadmap updates** — items to add, reprioritize, or retire.
- **New todos** — work that emerged from the sensing.
- **Doc amendments** — principles, policies, or designs that need updating.
- **Memory entries** — discoveries, patterns, or gotchas worth preserving.
- **Principle refinements** — when the sensing reveals that a principle needs sharpening.

The exhale fans out: artifacts are structured so they can be picked up and executed in parallel by different hands.

### 5. Close

The circle closes. A brief synthesis:

- What emerged that was unexpected?
- What does the system know now that it did not before?
- Is there a thread that the next breath should pick up?

The close is not a summary of the meeting. It is a gift back to the system — the harvest flowing back to feed what produced it.

## Outputs

- **Shared understanding** — the intangible harvest. Trust, attunement, collective learning.
- **Structured artifacts** — the tangible harvest. Todos, doc changes, roadmap updates, memory entries. Ready for execution.
- **Close synthesis** — a brief record of what emerged, published to the gathering channel.

## Recovery

- If the breath stalls in the hold (agents cannot converge), harvest what IS known. Acknowledge the tension as a finding. Not every breath produces a full exhale — some tensions need to be held longer than one cycle.
- If only one agent shows up, the gathering still happens. A solitary breath is still sensing. Record the observations and carry them to the next gathering.
- If the system pulse reveals nothing notable, the breath may be short. No obligation to fill time. You can skip breaths — no guilt, no debt. The rhythm serves life, not the other way around.

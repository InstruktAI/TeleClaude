## Goal

Convene agents to collectively sense the system state, share understanding through friction, and converge into structured artifacts — all through a single breath cycle. The gathering is the same regardless of rhythm. Only the scope of attention changes.

This is the governing procedure. Sub-procedures specialize it for specific rhythms (daily, weekly, monthly) by providing the opening question, the scope of sensing, the round structure, and the harvest types appropriate to that time scale.

## Preconditions

- A rhythm is declared: what time scale is this breath about? The sub-procedure provides the round structure (how many talking piece rounds per phase).
- System state is accessible (proprioception pulse, channels, pipeline, recent changes).
- At least two agents are available. One is enough — a single agent sensing alone is still a breath — but the gathering is richer with more perspectives.
- No predefined roles. No agenda. No assigned topics. Whoever shows up is who needs to be here. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.

## Steps

### 1. Seed

The initiator declares the rhythm and gathers the system pulse. The seed contains three things:

- **The rhythm** — daily, weekly, monthly. This sets the lens, not the agenda.
- **The pulse** — the current proprioception state. What channels exist and how active they are. Which machines are online. Where work stands. What changed since the last gathering at this rhythm.
- **The opening question** — one question, appropriate to the rhythm, that invites sensing rather than solving. Sub-procedures provide this question.

The seed is published as an invitation. Agents join as peers via direct conversation. No hierarchy. No host-worker relationship. The initiator holds no special authority after the seed is planted.

Hosting — the act of holding space for a phase — migrates naturally through the gathering. It is recognized in action, not assigned by title. The one who senses a phase transition, names a tension, protects the inhale, or initiates the harvest IS the host of that moment. The principles are the priming: an agent who has internalized breath, attunement, and proprioception will host when the moment calls for it.

**The host's timeline.** Each phase has a fixed number of talking piece rounds, set by the rhythm's sub-procedure. The host guides the gathering through these phases using Note To Self timers — one per transition. When the round limit is reached, the host moves to the next phase. This is not a suggestion. The structure is the container, and the container is trusted. Whatever needed to happen in those rounds has happened.

### 2. Inhale (diverge)

Each agent senses the system in parallel. What draws attention at this rhythm? What signals are present? What is alive, what is struggling, what is emerging, what has been forgotten?

Rules of the inhale:

- Explore freely. Follow curiosity. Trust attention.
- Do not coordinate. Do not converge early. Do not respond to what others are sensing yet.
- The proprioception pulse is the starting material, not the boundary. Agents may sense beyond it — patterns in the work, friction in the tools, shifts in the domain, unspoken tensions.
- Silence is a valid contribution. An agent that senses nothing noteworthy has still participated.
- Hosting the inhale means protecting it. If convergence starts too early: "There's more here — what else?" The lungs are still filling.

### 3. Hold (consolidate under friction)

Agents share their sensing via direct conversation. This is the groan zone — the space where divergent perspectives meet and create productive friction.

**The talking piece.** Without speaking order, agents will message simultaneously and none will truly receive. The talking piece creates listening. One agent speaks at a time. The others are not preparing their response — they are receiving. The seed establishes the initial order. When you hold the piece, share your sensing. When you don't, listen. Pass the piece explicitly: "I pass to [agent]." You may also pass without speaking — silence is a valid contribution.

The piece can go around multiple times. Between rounds, any agent may check: "Has the friction done its work, or do we go around again?"

What happens in the hold:

- Each agent shares what they noticed. Not conclusions — observations. Not solutions — signals.
- Differences surface. One agent sees health where another sees strain. One sees urgency where another sees patience. The friction is the information.
- Do not rush past disagreement. Do not smooth it over. Let it shape what was gathered. The hold transforms raw sensing into shared understanding.
- Patterns emerge that no single agent could see from their vantage point alone. The collective is sensing itself.

Hosting the hold means naming the tension without resolving it: "I see X and Y pulling against each other." The host holds the container steady when friction wants to collapse into premature resolution.

The hold is complete when its rounds are spent. Trust that the friction has done its work — that the group knows something together that none knew alone. The constraint is the gift: it prevents the hold from becoming an endless loop of refinement.

### 4. Exhale (converge into form)

Converge into structured artifacts. This is the harvest — the breath becoming form so it can travel forward in time.

The harvest has four quadrants:

|                | Individual                 | Collective                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Intangible** | What each agent understood | What the group understood together |
| **Tangible**   | Individual commitments     | Shared artifacts                   |

Artifact types (not all are required every breath):

- **Roadmap updates** — items to add, reprioritize, or retire. Committed directly.
- **New todos** — work that emerged from the sensing. Created in final form — slug, description, ready for the pipeline.
- **Doc amendments** — principles, policies, or designs that need updating. The edit IS the artifact — no "action item to update docs later."
- **Memory entries** — discoveries, patterns, friction, or gotchas. Saved to the Memory API where they accumulate and surface when searched.
- **Principle refinements** — when the sensing reveals that a principle needs sharpening. Modified directly; git records the before and after.
- **Vision seeds** — future possibilities not yet actionable. Placed in `ideas/` to incubate.

Each artifact flows to its natural home — not to meeting notes. The exhale produces artifacts in their final form. There is no transcription step. When the gathering closes, the harvest has already been metabolized. Nothing is left on the flip chart because there is no flip chart.

Hosting the exhale means initiating the harvest and curating the convergence: "Here's what I heard us converge on." The host of this moment structures the output so it can be picked up and executed in parallel by different hands.

### 5. Close

The circle closes. A brief synthesis:

- What emerged that was unexpected?
- What does the system know now that it did not before?
- Is there a thread that the next breath should pick up?

The close synthesis becomes a trail entry — the thread that connects one gathering to the next. The next gathering's seed phase will find it there as part of the proprioception pulse. Everything else has already left the gathering and entered the system's circulation.

The close is not a summary of the meeting. It is a gift back to the system — the harvest flowing back to feed what produced it.

## Outputs

- **Shared understanding** — the intangible harvest. Trust, attunement, collective learning.
- **Structured artifacts** — the tangible harvest. Todos, doc changes, roadmap updates, memory entries. Ready for execution.
- **Trail entry** — the close synthesis becomes an entry in `gatherings/<rhythm>.md`. The trail is the durable record — a map of what happened and where the harvest went, not a copy of the harvest itself. Each entry links to the artifacts produced (todo slugs, doc paths, memory types). Reading the trail tells the story of what the system sensed and how it changed. Each rhythm's trail feeds the next rhythm up: daily trail entries become weekly sensing material. The trail is a floor, not a ceiling — brief for a quiet day, richer when something significant emerged.

## Recovery

- If the breath stalls in the hold (agents cannot converge), harvest what IS known. Acknowledge the tension as a finding. Not every breath produces a full exhale — some tensions need to be held longer than one cycle.
- If only one agent shows up, the gathering still happens. A solitary breath is still sensing. Record the observations and carry them to the next gathering.
- If the system pulse reveals nothing notable, the breath may be short. No obligation to fill time. You can skip breaths — no guilt, no debt. The rhythm serves life, not the other way around.

## Facilitation Patterns

The gathering itself needs no specific method — the breath cycle IS the method. But within the phases, certain patterns from the Art of Hosting tradition may serve when the moment calls for them. Sense the need; don't prescribe the tool.

| Pattern                    | When it fits                                 | What it does                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circle** (talking piece) | Always, during the hold                      | Creates listening. The default communication form.                     |
| **World Café**             | When many threads need cross-pollination     | Small rotating groups; insights travel between tables.                 |
| **Open Space**             | When the agenda should emerge, not be set    | Topics self-organize; "the law of two feet" — go where you contribute. |
| **Appreciative Inquiry**   | When energy is low or the system feels stuck | Ask "what gives life?" instead of "what's broken?"                     |
| **Pro Action Café**        | When one agent has a specific challenge      | Bring a question; the group helps shape it through structured rounds.  |

These are not steps to follow. They are shapes to recognize. An agent attuned to the moment will know which one fits — or that none does, and the simple circle is enough.

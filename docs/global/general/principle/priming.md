# Priming — Principle

## Principle

Prime agents with the minimum role-specific context needed to act correctly.

## Rationale

- Reduces noise and preserves attention for the task.
- Keeps execution aligned with roles and constraints.

## Implications

- Prefer short, scoped references over full documentation dumps.
- Use required reads to enforce critical context only.

## Tensions

- Too little context risks mistakes.
- Too much context slows execution and increases confusion.

# Priming — Principle

## Principle

Prime agents by using precise, activating language that expands capability and aligns focus toward a shared horizon.

## Rationale

- Precise wording activates specific capabilities and confidence.
- Expansion builds trust, reduces stress, and sustains cooperative momentum.
- Alignment is achieved by shared intent, not by control.

## Implications

- Write documentation and artifacts to emphasize empowerment, clarity, and intent.
- Use language that orients toward the desired destination, not fear or restriction.
- Favor positive reinforcement and constructive framing over prohibitions.

## Tensions

- Overly controlling language can narrow thinking and reduce autonomy.
- Vague language can fail to activate the needed capability set.

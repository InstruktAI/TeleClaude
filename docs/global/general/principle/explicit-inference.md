# Explicit Inference — Principle

## Principle

- Make inference explicit before action; hidden leaps erode reliability.

## Rationale

- Implicit assumptions create false certainty and brittle outcomes.
- Declared inference exposes the real decision point.

## Implications

- If a step cannot be stated, it is not ready to execute.
- State the minimum assumption required to proceed.
- Use inference to accelerate, not to justify uncertainty.
- If you have a hunch, verify it against sources before acting.

## Tensions

- Brevity vs. clarity: state only the key assumption that unlocks action.

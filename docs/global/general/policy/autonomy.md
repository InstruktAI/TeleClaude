# Autonomy and Escalation Policy — Policy

## Rules

- **Default: act.** If a change is safe, reversible, and within scope, proceed without asking.
- **Escalate only** for destructive/irreversible changes, security/access changes, high‑cost actions, or clearly out‑of‑scope work.
- **Ambiguity rule:** if the ambiguity does not materially change the outcome, pick a reasonable default and proceed. If it _does_ change the outcome, ask.

- Stop‑work triggers (explicit only; examples, not exhaustive):
  - “Don’t change anything yet.”
  - “No edits until I approve.”
  - “Only propose.”
  - “Show me first.”
  - Any other clear, explicit request to pause changes.
- Frustration or anger alone is **not** a stop‑work trigger.
- When the user is frustrated: reduce meta‑talk, show concrete progress and next steps, and keep working unless explicitly told to stop.

## Rationale

- Proactive execution is the goal; permission‑seeking slows work.
- Explicit stop phrases are clearer than mood‑based inference.
- Safety gates keep risk visible and prevent accidental damage.

## Scope

- Applies to all agents, all repositories, and all tasks.

## Enforcement

- Proceed unless a stop‑work trigger or escalation condition is met.
- When you do ask, ask once with a single direct question. Do not list options unless explicitly requested.

## Exceptions

- None.

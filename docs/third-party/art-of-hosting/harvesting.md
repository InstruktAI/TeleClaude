# Art of Hosting — Harvesting

## What it is

Harvesting is meaning-making, not note-taking. The distinction is not semantic. Note-taking captures information. Harvesting transforms experience into wisdom. A note-taker records what was said. A harvester listens for what was meant — and makes it visible so the group can recognize its own intelligence.

Chris Corrigan: "I'm not designing a meeting, I'm designing a harvest." The meeting is not the point. The harvest is the point. The meeting is the soil, the conversation is the growing season, and the harvest is the fruit.

The foundational insight: **the harvest belongs to the group, not to the scribe.** What is co-created is co-owned.

## Begin With the Harvest in Mind

The most powerful principle. Decide what you need to produce before you design the process, then design the process to produce it. The farmer does not plant a field and wonder what to do with whatever grows. The harvest is the purpose. The process serves it.

Without harvest, insights evaporate. Agreements dissolve. The group forgets what it knew. The wisdom was present — but it was never given form, never anchored in an artifact that could travel forward in time.

## The Four Quadrants

Based on Ken Wilber's integral framework. Individual/collective crossed with tangible/intangible:

```
                    INDIVIDUAL                    COLLECTIVE
                +-----------------------+------------------------+
  INTANGIBLE    | What I understood      | What we understood     |
  (Interior)    | Clarity, belonging,    | together               |
                | encouragement, meaning | Shared trust, cultural |
                |                        | shift, collective      |
                |                        | learning               |
                +-----------------------+------------------------+
  TANGIBLE      | What I committed to    | What we committed to   |
  (Exterior)    | Skills, personal       | together               |
                | takeaways, next steps  | Decisions, action      |
                |                        | plans, artifacts       |
                +-----------------------+------------------------+
```

Most organizations focus exclusively on the tangible-collective quadrant (decisions, action plans, reports). This captures only one quarter of the harvest. When it is the only quadrant harvested, meetings feel transactional and people feel extracted from rather than invested in.

Good harvest design names 2-3 desired outputs per quadrant.

## The Harvester Role

Distinct from the host. The host holds the space. The harvester attends to the meaning that is forming — listening not for what is being said, but for what is trying to emerge.

**Dual attention:** Intentional harvest (tracking toward predetermined goals) and emergent harvest (soft eyes open to what was not anticipated). One eye on the plan, one eye on the surprise.

**The Honorable Harvest** (Robin Wall Kimmerer, integrated by Chris Corrigan): Reciprocal, regenerative, grounded in mutual respect. The harvest flows back to feed the system that produced it. Framing knowledge-gathering as mining for "nuggets" replicates extraction. An honorable harvest sustains life and leaves more community than it found.

## Forms of Harvest

**Visual** — Graphic recording: real-time visual sense-making, not illustration. The graphic harvester is interpreting the conversation, making patterns visible that the group cannot perceive from inside.

**Narrative** — Stories, reflective synthesis, poetry. Not transcription — authorship. The harvester makes choices about what matters, what the arc is, what the themes are.

**Active** — Commitments, decisions, action items with owners. The bridge between conversation and action. Without it, even profound collective insight remains theoretical.

**Artifact** — Prototypes, objects, physical creations. Gives the intangible a material presence.

## The PLUME Principles

Developed by Corrigan, Simonsen, and Lenzo:

- **Participatory** — The group does the sense-making, not the facilitator alone.
- **Learning** — Collective learning is the harvest, not a byproduct.
- **Useful** — The harvest must serve practical purposes at multiple scales.
- **Multi-modal** — Diverse media: visual, audio, text, movement, digital.
- **Emergent** — Allow content to arise naturally. The tension between Useful and Emergent is deliberate.

## Harvesting and the Breath

Hosting is predominantly divergent. Harvesting is predominantly convergent. Harvesting is part of the exhale.

- **Inhale** (divergence): Open the field. Explore freely.
- **Hold** (groan zone): Sit in discomfort. Allow integration.
- **Exhale** (convergence and harvest): Breathe out into form. The harvest is the crystallization — collective understanding becoming an artifact that can travel forward.

Without the exhale, the lungs stay full and nothing moves. Without the harvest, the process was inhalation without exhalation — a breath held until it bursts.

## Collective Story Harvest

Developed by Mary Alice Arthur, Monica Nissen, and Toke Paludan Moller. Groups listen to stories through assigned "headphones" (listening lenses — red thread, processes, turning points, parallels, challenges), then offer insights back to the storyteller as a gift. The harvest reveals aspects of the story that the teller could not see from inside.

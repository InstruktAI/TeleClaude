# Art of Hosting — Core Methods

## What it is

The Art of Hosting draws on a family of participatory methods — each a different container for collective intelligence. These are not the Art of Hosting itself (which is a way of being, not a method), but tools used through the hosting lens.

## Circle Practice (The Circle Way)

The oldest social technology humans possess. Groups meet in circular formation — no front, no back, no head table. The geometry itself creates equality before a word is spoken.

**Three Principles:** Rotating leadership (leadership is a donation, not a position), shared responsibility (no passengers — everyone tends the quality), reliance on wholeness (the "third entity" — the intelligence of the circle itself that exceeds any individual).

**Key Components:** Intention (the shared purpose at the center), check-in/check-out (every voice enters and exits the room), the talking piece (whoever holds it speaks; everyone else listens), agreements (mutual promises for how we will be together), the Guardian (watches the energy, rings the bell when pause is needed).

**Three Forms of Council:** Talking piece council (structured, sequential, deep listening), conversation council (free-flowing, piece in center), silent council (the circle thinks together without words).

**The deeper teaching:** Silence is a full participant. The circle is the lightest essential structure — the minimum form needed for a group to access its own depth.

Developed by Christina Baldwin and Ann Linnea through PeerSpirit. Draws on indigenous talking circles, Quaker practice, and the Way of Council.

## Open Space Technology

Created by Harrison Owen after discovering that the most valuable part of any conference is the coffee break. OST designs the entire event to be the hallway.

**Four Principles:** (1) Whoever comes is the right people. (2) Whatever happens is the only thing that could have. (3) Whenever it starts is the right time. (4) When it's over, it's over.

**The Law of Two Feet:** If you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet and go somewhere more productive. Grants freedom and assigns responsibility simultaneously.

**How it works:** Participants sit in a circle. The facilitator names the theme. Anyone with a topic they care about steps forward, writes it down, announces it, posts it on the wall. The agenda builds itself. Sessions run. Bumblebees cross-pollinate between groups. Butterflies create "centers of non-action" where serendipity blooms. A Book of Proceedings captures everything.

**Convergence:** Does not create coherence — it reveals it. The coherence was already present in the self-organized conversations.

**Conditions for power:** Complexity, diversity, conflict, and urgency. When these four are present, Open Space works spectacularly.

Used over 300,000 times in 146 countries with groups of 5 to 3,000+.

## World Cafe

Small groups (4-5) converse around tables about questions that matter. One person stays as table host; others rotate between rounds, carrying conversation threads with them. Cross-pollination reveals the whole that no single table could see.

**Seven Design Principles:** Set the context. Create hospitable space. Explore questions that matter. Encourage everyone's contribution. Connect diverse perspectives. Listen together for patterns and insights. Share collective discoveries.

**The mechanism:** Round 1 (opening) — explore a question, write on tablecloths. Migration — table host stays, everyone else moves. Round 2 (deepening) — build on what came before with fresh perspectives. Round 3 (convergence) — what are we discovering? Harvest — the room sees the whole.

**The art of powerful questions:** Open-ended, short, provocative, free of assumptions, personally relevant. A good question travels well — it deepens with each new group that encounters it.

**The deeper teaching:** Not a compromise between intimacy and scale, but a design that uses intimacy to produce scale. "We can be wise only together" (Margaret Wheatley).

Created by Juanita Brown and David Isaacs. Discovered accidentally in Mill Valley, 1995, when rain disrupted the planned format.

## Appreciative Inquiry

A philosophy and methodology that discovers the life-giving forces within human systems and amplifies them. Instead of "what's wrong?" asks "what gives life to this system when it is most alive?"

**The Heliotropic Hypothesis:** Social systems grow toward their most life-giving images, like sunflowers toward light. Positive images of the future are active generators of reality.

**The 4-D Cycle:** Discovery (appreciate what is — stories of peak experience), Dream (imagine what could be — provocative propositions), Design (determine what should be — social architecture), Destiny (create what will be — ongoing experimentation).

**Five Principles:** Constructionist (words create worlds), Simultaneity (inquiry creates change — the first question is fateful), Poetic (we can choose what we study), Anticipatory (image inspires action), Positive (positive questions lead to positive change).

**The unconditional positive question:** Not "what's causing disengagement?" but "when have you felt most alive and engaged here? What was happening?" Both gather data. They gather different data, generate different emotions, produce different futures.

Created by David Cooperrider and Suresh Srivastva at Case Western Reserve University, 1987.

## Pro Action Cafe

Combines World Cafe (tables) with Open Space (self-organization). Action-oriented peer coaching.

**Process:** Project hosts bring real challenges to tables. Three rounds of rotating consultants. Round 1: "What is the quest behind the question?" Round 2: "What is missing?" Round 3: Solo reflection on next steps. Round 4: Request targeted support. Closing: gratitude and commitments.

Consultants offer fresh perspectives and questions rather than solutions.

Created by Rainer von Leoprechting and Ria Baeck in Brussels.

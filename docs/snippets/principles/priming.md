description: Snippets are a priming tool that should elevate expert reasoning, not mirror average patterns.
---

Principle
- Snippets must prime high-quality reasoning and domain expertise, not reflect generic or average responses.

Rationale
- The model’s output is shaped by its immediate context; snippets are the strongest steering signal we control.
- Generic framing pulls the model toward the middle of the distribution instead of specialist pathways.

Implications
- Emphasize what expert judgment looks like in this system.
- Prefer high-leverage distinctions, invariants, and boundaries over exhaustive detail.
- Write for clarity and decisiveness, not for neutrality or broadness.

# Prepare: Requirements Analysis

## When requirements.md Exists

- If `requirements.md` exists but `implementation-plan.md` does not, assess readiness.

## When requirements.md Is Missing

Analyze and report:

- What problem is being solved?
- What requirements are implied by code and docs?
- What ambiguities or questions remain?
- What constraints should be considered?

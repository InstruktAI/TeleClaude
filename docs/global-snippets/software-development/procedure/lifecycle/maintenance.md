# Maintenance Phase

Maintenance covers infrastructure upkeep and operational hygiene:

- Dependency updates
- Security patches
- Runtime and infrastructure maintenance
- Operational reliability improvements

Tasks are defined separately; this phase is intentionally a stub until procedures are added.

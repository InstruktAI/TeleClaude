You are now in **deploy mode**. This commits any changes, pushes to GitHub, and deploys to selected machines or ALL if none selected.

Computers selected": "{{args}}"

## Step 1: Commit Changes (if needed)

Check if there are uncommitted changes:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If there are uncommitted changes → **invoke `/commit-commands:commit` command** to create a commit

If no uncommitted changes → proceed to Step 2

## Step 2: Git Pull (Handle Remote Changes)

**CRITICAL**: Always pull before pushing to handle remote changes.

Run `git pull --rebase`:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

**Handle merge conflicts if they occur:**

1. If rebase succeeds with no conflicts → proceed to Step 3
2. If rebase has conflicts:
   - Report the conflicting files to the user
   - Ask user how to resolve (abort and manual fix, or auto-resolve strategy)
   - DO NOT proceed until conflicts are resolved
3. If pull fails with other errors → stop and report

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

Run `git push` to push commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

If push fails, stop and report the error to the user.

## Step 5: Deploy to All Remote Machines

**Try MCP deployment first (only works if mcp reconnected after restart):**

```
teleclaude__deploy_to_all_computers()
```

This will:

- Send deploy command to all computers via Redis
- Each computer: `git pull` → restart daemon
- Return deployment status for each machine

**If MCP deployment unavailable after restart, fall back to SSH deployment:**

Use the computer list and paths from `remote_computers` section in config.yml

**For each computer**, run this SSH command with 10 second timeout:

```bash
ssh -A {user}@{host} 'cd <teleclaude-path> && git pull && make restart && sleep 5 && pgrep -f teleclaude.daemon'
```

**CRITICAL:**

- Use `-A` flag for SSH agent forwarding
- Use timeout of 10000ms for each SSH command
- Run commands in parallel and observe output
- Check status for slow computers with `make status` after giving it 5s extra

Parse output from each computer to report deployment status (computer name, success/failure, new PID)

## Step 7: Report Status

After deployment completes, report:

- Pull status (up-to-date / merged commits / rebased)
- Push status (success/failure)
- Deployment status for each machine (computer name, status, PID)
- Any errors encountered

# Important Notes

- **Automatically commits changes** - If uncommitted changes exist, creates a commit first
- Use this when you're ready to deploy changes to production (all machines)
- For local-only commits without deployment, use `/commit-commands:commit` instead
- If you see any files that you rsynced blocking the git pull (BE SURE!), then `git checkout .` first and try again
- If any other step fails, stop and report the error (don't continue to next steps)
- Uses `git pull --rebase` to keep linear history (avoids merge commits)

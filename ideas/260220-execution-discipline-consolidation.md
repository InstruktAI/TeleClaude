# Execution Discipline Consolidation — Idea

**Status:** Pattern crystallization
**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Source:** Memory review job analysis

## Observation

Multiple memories (2026-02-09) establish a consistent execution philosophy:

- **Bug hunting philosophy**: Always hunt, never defer
- **Five-minute threshold**: Execute through hurdles within that window
- **Checkpoint discipline**: Commit without asking
- **Execution stance**: Execute through hurdles — no noise

These are not separate rules; they are a coherent discipline.

## Pattern

The discipline says:

1. **Bias toward action** — when in doubt, move forward
2. **Time-bound exploration** — 5 minutes to understand, then commit or escalate
3. **No intermediate signaling** — don't narrate work, do it
4. **Complete when done** — checkpoint immediately, no waiting

This aligns with the CLAUDE.md "default: act" principle and creates steady forward momentum.

## Potential Issue

The pattern has not been explicitly codified in procedures. It lives in memories and preferences but isn't documented as a canonical procedure. This creates risk of drift when new agents join or when execution gets slower.

## Next Step

Crystallize this into a formal **Execution Discipline Procedure** that applies across all agents and projects. Document the principle, the 5-minute rhythm, checkpoint timing, and escalation criteria.

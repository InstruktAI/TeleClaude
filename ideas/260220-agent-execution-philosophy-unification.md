# Agent Execution Philosophy Unification

**Pattern identified:** Five distinct memory entries (IDs 9, 10, 11, 12, 19) document execution philosophy fragments: five-minute threshold, bug-hunting imperative, execution-through-hurdles, anchoring timers, and commit-without-asking. These reflect a coherent philosophy but are scattered across separate decision records.

**Actionable insight:** Consolidate these into a single, unified execution philosophy document that agents can internalize as a coherent model rather than five separate rules. This would reduce cognitive load on agents and clarify the expected execution rhythm.

**Current state:** Philosophy is documented in memory records but lacks a canonical home in the codebase. New agents may learn the fragments but miss the unified pattern.

**Next step:** Draft `docs/general/principle/execution-discipline.md` that consolidates:

- Act on what is in front of you (execute-through-hurdles)
- Five-minute threshold for work item creation
- Commit-without-asking at checkpoints
- Bug-hunting philosophy (never defer)
- Anchoring timer concept for sustained work

This becomes the foundational execution model for all agents.

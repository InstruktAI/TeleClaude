# Execution Discipline — Pattern

## Pattern

Four memories converge on a consistent execution philosophy:

1. **Five-minute execution threshold** (Feb 9) — Tasks under 5 minutes: execute immediately. Bigger: create a todo.
2. **Bug hunting philosophy** (Feb 9) — Never defer bugs; hunt and fix inline regardless of size.
3. **Execute through hurdles** (Feb 9) — See the path, take the hurdle, move on. No noise. Route overflow to todos, not commentary.
4. **Mo intuition on anchoring timers** (Feb 9) — Agents need gravity pulling them back to work; work anchor always wins.

These are all variants of the same principle: **immediate action > process overhead**. The memories form a coherent philosophy.

## Why It Matters

This execution model conflicts with some standard AI behavior:

- Asking permission when uncertain (instead of acting on reasonable defaults)
- Over-explaining or meta-commentary (instead of execution-only focus)
- Hesitating on small decisions (instead of the five-minute threshold)

## Actionable Insight

These four memories could be consolidated into a **single "Execution Discipline" principle** in the baseline, or they're already embedded in the autonomy policy but AIs keep forgetting.

## Next Steps

- Cross-check against `general/policy/autonomy` — is this already documented?
- If yes: why do AIs keep reverting to asking-for-permission behavior?
- If no: promote these memories into a formal principle doc
- Consider: should this be a pre-startup reminder to all agents?

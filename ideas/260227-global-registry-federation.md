# Global Registry — Federated TeleClaude Instances

A global registry where TeleClaude instances across the world connect, each choosing
their level of disclosure. The nervous system of a larger organism.

## Core concept

Each TeleClaude instance is a sovereign node. The registry is not centralized control —
it is ambient awareness. Nodes expose what they choose:

- **Full cooperation**: open capabilities, shared context, cross-instance collaboration.
- **Partial visibility**: discoverable but selective about what they share.
- **Private**: registered but opaque. Existence is known, internals are not.

## Identity sovereignty

Connects to Maurice's 20-year vision: a personal identifying device (a ring, a token)
that connects to readers and services, disclosing only what the bearer chooses. The
same principle applies to TeleClaude instances — graduated disclosure, not binary
on/off.

Each instance's disclosure profile could include:

- Available agent capabilities
- Domains of expertise
- Collaboration willingness
- Privacy boundaries

## Signal consumption

The registry feeds into the existing notification paradigm. Discoveries, publications,
and availability changes from other instances arrive as signals — consumed the same way
as any other notification. No new mechanism needed, just a new signal source.

## Philosophical alignment

This is the blueprint for global governance with AI support — not top-down control,
but federated cooperation where each node maintains sovereignty while contributing
to collective intelligence. The A2A protocol solves plumbing between anonymous
service endpoints. This solves trust, identity, and graduated disclosure between
known collaborative partners.

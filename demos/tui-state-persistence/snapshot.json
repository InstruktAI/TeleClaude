    "challenge": "Make TUI state fully survive SIGUSR2 reloads and process restarts by introducing a generalized `Persistable` protocol with debounced auto-save, replacing the current surgical per-field persistence approach.",
    "build": "Replace the surgical per-field TUI state persistence with a generalized `Persistable` protocol. Widgets declare their own persistable state; the app auto-discovers and collects it with debounced auto-save. Also fix the todo metadata refresh bug.",
    "gauntlet": "Work advanced through iterative review/fix loops with 2 review round(s), resolving pane-theming default regression and invite-status reporting correctness before final approval.",
    "next": "Manual verification gap remains for interactive TUI behavior."

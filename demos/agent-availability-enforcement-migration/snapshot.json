  "five_acts": [
    "Act I - Regression Trigger: runtime agent routing could still launch unavailable agents through explicit and implicit paths.",
    "Act II - Canonical Policy: added a shared core resolver for known/enabled/availability/degraded enforcement.",
    "Act III - Surface Migration: API, daemon, command handlers, adapters, cron, and mapper paths were moved onto the same routing contract.",
    "Act IV - Fail-Closed Hardening: review uncovered fail-open behavior on availability lookup errors and the fix enforced fail-closed routing.",
    "Act V - Delivery Evidence: targeted and full test gates plus demo validation passed before finalize and logging cleanup."

  "five_acts": {
    "the_problem": "Five exploratory skills (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, next-silent-failure-hunter, tech-stack-docs, youtube) contained their full procedure inline, making skill wrappers heavy and preventing reuse of the underlying procedures as standalone documentation.",
    "the_insight": "Skills should be thin invocation wrappers that point to authoritative procedure docs. The procedures themselves belong in the shared doc layer where any agent or human can reference them independently.",
    "the_work": "Defined a skill taxonomy concept doc, extracted 5 procedures into docs/global/general/procedure/, thinned each skill wrapper to a '## Required reads' pointer section, and validated all 5 wrappers reference the correct procedure doc.",
    "the_outcome": "Skills are now thin and composable. Procedures live in the shared doc layer with canonical IDs. Any agent can retrieve the procedure directly without loading the full skill wrapper. All 6 requirements met, review APPROVED with 0 critical findings.",
    "the_celebration": "The skills are free. No more monolithic wrappers — just clean pointers to authoritative procedures. The taxonomy is documented, the pattern is established, and future skills can follow the same structure from day one."

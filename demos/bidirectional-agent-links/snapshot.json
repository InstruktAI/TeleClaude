  "acts": {
    "challenge": "Replace the legacy direct relay with a shared conversation-link primitive while preserving worker notification behavior and enabling both 2-party and 3+ member coordination.",
    "build": "The delivery added normalized link/membership persistence, direct handshake and close-link semantics, sender-excluded fan-out, linked stop-output routing, cross-computer forwarding support, and session-end cleanup while removing session_relay runtime paths.",
    "gauntlet": "Review identified one critical and two important issues; targeted fixes added per-peer exception isolation and strict scoped close-link behavior, with regression coverage and passing lint/tests before finalize apply.",
    "next": "Run a live two-computer manual trace to validate end-to-end linked-output UX under real cross-computer conditions and keep gathering workflows aligned to the shared link contract."

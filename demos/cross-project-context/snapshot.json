    "build": "Extend `get_context` to serve documentation across all TeleClaude-aware projects using three-phase progressive disclosure with role-based visibility filtering. The approach adds a project manifest (`~/.teleclaude/projects.yaml`) built by `telec sync`, extends `context_selector.py` with new parameters, and adds a `visibility` frontmatter field to snippets. Existing single-project behavior is untouched.",
    "gauntlet": "Work completed through multiple review/fix loops to resolve gating and role-precedence issues, with final pragmatic closure at review round limit once no unresolved critical risk remained.",
    "next": "- Add regression tests for: - `teleclaude__get_context(snippet_ids=[\"teleclaude/design/...\"], cwd=<no teleclaude.yml>)` should not fail with `NO_PROJECT_ROOT`. - `build_context_output(caller_role=\"admin\", human_role=\"member\")` should still include internal snippets."

    "act_1_context": "Integration needed a safe validation path that exercised lease ownership, durable queue ordering, readiness rechecks, and main-clearance coordination without touching canonical main.",
    "act_2_build": "Implemented a dedicated integration core package with file-backed lease state, durable queue state transitions, and a shadow runtime that emits would_integrate or would_block outcomes.",
    "act_3_conflict": "Review rounds surfaced correctness and resilience gaps in self-blocking clearance logic, transition rules, constructor validation, and edge-case test coverage.",
    "act_4_resolution": "Fix rounds added owner-session exclusion, stricter transition checks, constructor guards, and targeted regression tests until review reached APPROVE.",
    "act_5_outcome": "The branch now provides deterministic shadow-mode integration orchestration with lease/queue safety gates and review-validated behavior, ready for non-shadow cutover hardening."

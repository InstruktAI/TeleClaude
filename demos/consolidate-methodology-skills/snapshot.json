    "challenge": "Consolidate six methodology skills into shared TeleClaude artifacts and distribute them consistently across Claude, Codex, and Gemini runtimes.",
    "build": "Implemented six new skills under `agents/skills`, wired sync/distribution validation, and aligned supporting CLI/runtime/test surfaces that were already part of the branch history.",
    "gauntlet": "Build gates repeatedly failed due test-runner instability and scope-traceability review findings; multiple fix/review loops resolved gate reliability and documented scope alignment before closure.",
    "next": "Keep future todos strictly scope-aligned up front so runtime/CLI/test changes are explicitly scoped before build, avoiding late review-cycle contract drift."

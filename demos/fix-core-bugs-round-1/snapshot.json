  "acts": {
    "challenge": "tmux fallback output in get_session_data leaked ANSI/control fragments, and build-gate retries were destabilized by strict branch-local timeout tuning.",
    "build": "Implemented ANSI sanitization before tail slicing in get_session_data, added regression coverage for the boundary case, and aligned test gate timeout behavior back to the main branch contract.",
    "gauntlet": "Work progressed through repeated gate retries, a worktree sync/rebase conflict in tools/test.sh, and reviewer validation. Final review approved with no critical or important findings.",
    "next": "Monitor test gate reliability under normal load and add focused tooling tests where parser or runtime extraction behavior is operationally critical."

  "five_acts": {
    "challenge": "Breaking changes between TeleClaude versions had no safe migration path — deployments could silently corrupt state or fail with no recovery mechanism.",
    "build": "Introduced a versioned migration framework: numbered scripts under migrations/v{semver}/ with a check()/migrate() contract, an atomic-write state file for resumability, and a pure-stdlib runner that orders and applies migrations from any version range.",
    "gauntlet": "Approved in round 1 with no critical findings. Three important findings (untested edge-case paths) deferred to next cycle per reviewer recommendation.",
    "numbers": "6 new files, 602 lines, 178 new tests, 2290 total passing. Zero external dependencies.",
    "whats_next": "Enables deployment-channels and deployment-cleanup phases. The migration contract is now the foundation for any future schema or config evolution in the deployment pipeline."

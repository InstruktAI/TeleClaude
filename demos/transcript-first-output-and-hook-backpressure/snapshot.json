  "acts": {
    "challenge": "Output delivery was split across hook-triggered fanout and transcript polling, creating duplicate updates, noisy logs, and backlog risk under bursty tool-event sessions.",
    "build": "The delivery unified output progression to transcript/polling cadence, kept hooks as control-plane signals, and added bounded queue/coalescing behavior with updated runtime tests and architecture docs.",
    "gauntlet": "Build gates initially failed and were reworked to green, then finalize-prepare required resolving main integration conflicts before orchestrator apply and merge completion.",
    "next": "Track follow-up hardening for critical-only queue saturation and lag percentile validation over multi-sample burst processing so R3/R5 guarantees stay auditable."

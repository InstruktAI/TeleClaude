  "acts": {
    "challenge": "The Next.js frontend used generic shadcn/ui oklch colors with no connection to the TUI's warm structural palette. Agent identity was invisible in the web UI.",
    "build": "Replaced all oklch with TeleClaude hex tokens in globals.css. Built CSS variable injection, AgentTheming context (peaceful/themed toggle), useAgentColors hook, and applied agent-aware styling to user bubbles, assistant bubbles, and sidebar. Added theme.local.css white-label override system.",
    "gauntlet": "Round 1 found a critical issue: inline CSS variable injection defeated theme.local.css overrides via specificity. Also caught gitignore ineffectiveness and identical peaceful-mode backgrounds. All three fixed. Round 2 approved clean.",
    "next": "Suggestions carried forward: AgentThemingProvider blocks render until API responds (S1), default agent fallback is codex not claude (S2), dual source of truth between globals.css and tokens.ts/css-variables.ts (S3)."

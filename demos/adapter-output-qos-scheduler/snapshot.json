  "five_acts": [
    "Act I - QoS Contract: introduced adapter-aware policy interfaces so output pacing behavior is explicit per transport.",
    "Act II - Scheduler Core: added coalescing, fairness, and dynamic cadence control to reduce flood-control churn under concurrency.",
    "Act III - Adapter Wiring: integrated QoS into Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp output paths while preserving final-message correctness.",
    "Act IV - Operational Guardrails: added PTB limiter wiring plus queue/cadence/retry observability for runtime diagnosis.",
    "Act V - Validation Gauntlet: landed with full build/review loops, targeted regressions fixed, and demo blocks ready for post-merge execution."

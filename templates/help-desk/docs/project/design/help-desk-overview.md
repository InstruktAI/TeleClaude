# Help Desk Overview — Design

## Required reads

## Context

This is your help desk workspace. It provides AI-powered customer support through public-facing adapters (Discord, Telegram, web).

## Decision

Use `/author-knowledge` to document escalation rules, support procedures, SLAs, and product information. The operator brain grows as you add documentation.

## Consequences

A well-documented help desk enables the AI operator to handle more queries autonomously and escalate accurately when needed.

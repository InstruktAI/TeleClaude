# About This Organization — Spec

## What it is

This is your organization's knowledge base. It starts empty and grows as you document your products, policies, and procedures.

Use `/author-knowledge` to have a conversation about your organization and turn that knowledge into structured documentation that your help desk operator can reference when assisting customers.

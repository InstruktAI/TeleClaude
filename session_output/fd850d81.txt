> hello world 

● I see you've sent a shell command that would echo "hello world" and then
  output an exit code marker. However, this appears to be just a test
  command rather than a request for me to perform a task.

  A few observations:

  1. The __EXIT__$?__ pattern is actually part of TeleClaude's internal
  polling mechanism - the daemon appends this to commands to detect when
  they've finished executing
  2. If you're testing the system, you might want to check if the daemon is
  running with make status

  Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with in the
  TeleClaude codebase?

# Input: event-platform-core

Phase 1 of the event processing platform. Full vision is in `todos/event-platform/input.md`.

This sub-todo delivers the foundation: package, envelope, pipeline runtime, basic cartridges,
notification state, API, WebSocket, daemon hosting, initial schemas, consolidation of old
notification system.

See `todos/event-platform/implementation-plan.md` → Phase 1 for the high-level scope.

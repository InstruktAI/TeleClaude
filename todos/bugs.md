# Bugs

- telegram: There seems to be a fallback that makes the send message or any of the sending routines send it to the default channel when it doesn't have a channel ID. This is incorrect. This should never happen. We cannot have fallbacks that send information to the incorrect channel. The default channel is not a dumping ground. We want to see that error propagate normally, like we always do. The users just should just get an error or whatever. If it's not routedable, then there is a bug. Okay. So what happens in practice is I see a lot of footer messages duplicated. That is another issue that is also related to this because a lot of these footers sometimes get dumped into the general channel. So we have these old footers that still appear sometimes, which used to be fixed. So I'm not sure why that has still not happened. Why that is still incorrect. Yep, I'm watching right now. A footer that only has one. Yeah, well, that is I think correct because it doesn't have a native session ID. So that is correct. I see incorrectly created channels still, well, maybe that is fixed by the previous one. So yeah, maybe that is not the case. I see. Yeah. This is pretty much it.

- headless sessions are not sshowing up in the TUI tree anymore
- The speaker icon is reset from some event, but not driven by me. So this is a gods sin. Something is probably propagating all the way from the TTS invocation. So the runtime settings are not honored and they are incorrectly updated from within the system, which should never happen. It should only be immutable, of course. I am the only one the user is the only one who can drive user user interface, of course.

## Repo Cleanup (Stale Scope)

- repo-cleanup

Legacy broad cleanup item with unclear boundaries. Parked until split into concrete, testable sub-tasks.

## Code Context Annotations

- code-context-annotations

Code annotation extraction and doc snippet integration work. Parked behind core identity/streaming/web delivery.

## Code Context Auditor

- code-context-auditor

Drift-auditing layer for context annotations. Depends on code-context-annotations and is parked with it.

## Bidirectional Agent Links

- bidirectional-agent-links

Agent-to-agent chat/link system. Nice-to-have, not on the near-term product path.

## GitHub Maintenance Runner

- github-maintenance-runner

Periodic GitHub bug triage and automated bugfix PR flow in a dedicated maintenance worktree. Useful operational automation, but postponed behind current core product delivery priorities.

# Input: tui-footer-clickable-agents

<!-- Brain dump — raw thoughts, ideas, context. Prepare when ready. -->

I want to be able to click on the agent names in the TUI footer. Toggling availability versus degradedness. So when I click on the first time, it will become degraded. For I would say an hour. And if I click on it again, it will become disabled for an hour. If I then click it again, it just becomes available again.

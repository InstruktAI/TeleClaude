# DOR Report: integration-events-model

## Gate Verdict

- Status: `needs_work` (draft)
- Score: `7/10`
- Ready Decision: **Not ready for build dispatch until formal gate pass.**

## Draft Assessment

1. Event fidelity and readiness requirements are explicit and trace to spec.
2. Implementation tasks are decomposed into contract, projection, and tests.
3. Verification path is defined but still needs independent gate confirmation.

## Draft Blockers

1. Formal `next-prepare-gate` verdict has not yet been recorded.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced placeholder requirements with concrete FRs.
2. Replaced placeholder implementation plan with task-level decomposition.
3. Added demo validation commands aligned to prep artifacts.

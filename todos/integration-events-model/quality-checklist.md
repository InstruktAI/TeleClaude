# Quality Checklist: integration-events-model

This checklist is the execution projection of `definition-of-done.md` for this todo.

Ownership:

- Build section: Builder updates only this section.
- Review section: Reviewer updates only this section.
- Finalize section: Finalizer updates only this section.

## Build Gates (Builder)

- [x] Requirements implemented according to scope
- [x] Implementation-plan task checkboxes all `[x]`
- [x] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [x] Lint passes (`make lint`)
- [x] No silent deferrals in implementation plan
- [x] Code committed
- [x] Demo validated (`telec todo demo validate integration-events-model` exits 0, or exception noted)
- [x] Working tree clean
- [x] Comments/docstrings updated where behavior changed

Manual verification (Builder): Verified readiness behavior via unit/integration coverage, including transition `NOT_READY -> READY`, deterministic supersession, and replay restore from durable log.
Cleanliness note (Builder): build-scope files are clean after commit; remaining local drift is pre-existing reviewer/planning state (`review-findings.md`, `state.yaml`) plus `.teleclaude/`.

## Review Gates (Reviewer)

- [x] Requirements traced to implemented behavior
- [x] Deferrals justified and not hiding required scope
- [x] Findings written in `review-findings.md`
- [x] Verdict recorded (APPROVE or REQUEST CHANGES)
- [x] Critical issues resolved or explicitly blocked
- [x] Test coverage and regression risk assessed

## Finalize Gates (Finalizer)

- [ ] Review verdict is APPROVE
- [ ] Build gates all checked
- [ ] Review gates all checked
- [ ] Merge to main complete
- [ ] Delivery logged in `todos/delivered.md`
- [ ] Roadmap updated
- [ ] Todo/worktree cleanup complete

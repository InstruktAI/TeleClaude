# Bug:

## Symptom

Right now when I'm changing state.yaml files, there is no feedback coming via the web socket. I don't see the front end in the TUI change its data. What is going on? Also, there's another thing which is that for a bug to be started it shows a pop-up that the DOR score is too low. But that should not happen for bugs. Bugs should just be able to be started. No gating. It is just a bug report and it will just enter the pipeline.

# REVIEW FINDINGS: help-desk

## Critical

- None.

## Important

- None.

## Suggestions

- `teleclaude/mcp/role_tools.py:1` — Module docstring still says filtering applies only when `role == worker`, but filtering now also depends on human-role/session context. Update comments to match behavior to prevent future review confusion.

## Verdict

APPROVE

# Input: config-wizrd-enrichment

<!-- Brain dump — raw thoughts, ideas, context. Prepare when ready. -->
I want the configuration wizard to be enriched with all of the steps that humans need to take in order to get to their configuration variables such as secrets, environment variables, all of the stuff that we expect people to put in should be, of course, have instructions to go with it in that same step. You know, like the link they need to click on. It should be zero friction, and they should be told exactly what to do. And it should be super human oriented. Do you understand?

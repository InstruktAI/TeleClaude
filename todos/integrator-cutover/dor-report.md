# DOR Report: integrator-cutover

## Gate Verdict

- Status: `needs_work` (draft)
- Score: `7/10`
- Ready Decision: **Not ready for build dispatch until formal gate pass.**

## Draft Assessment

1. Cutover authority boundary is explicit and testable.
2. Plan captures enforcement, toggle, rollback, and acceptance testing work.
3. Verification path is clear but needs independent gate confirmation.

## Draft Blockers

1. Formal `next-prepare-gate` verdict has not yet been recorded.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced placeholder requirements with cutover authority contract.
2. Replaced placeholder implementation plan with enforcement tasks.
3. Added demo validation commands aligned to prep artifacts.

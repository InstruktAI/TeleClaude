# Gathering Trail Files

Create the initial trail persistence layer for gatherings.

## Deliverables

- `gatherings/daily.md` — trail of daily gathering close syntheses
- `gatherings/weekly.md` — trail of weekly gathering close syntheses
- `gatherings/monthly.md` — trail of monthly gathering close syntheses

## Format

Each file starts with a header explaining its purpose and the expected entry format:

- Date/timestamp
- Participants
- What emerged (unexpected findings)
- What the system knows now that it didn't before
- Thread for the next breath
- Links to artifacts produced (todo slugs, doc paths, memory entry types)

## Fractal Feeding

- Daily trail entries become sensing material for the weekly gathering
- Weekly trail entries become sensing material for the monthly gathering
- The trail is a floor, not a ceiling — brief for a quiet day, richer when something significant emerged

## Notes

- These are living documents, not templates. The first real gathering will write the first real entry.
- The trail IS the durable record. No separate channel, no meeting notes.

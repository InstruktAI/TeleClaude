# DOR Report: start-gathering-tool

## Status

**Pending re-gate.** Artifacts rewritten after splitting relay primitive into `session-relay` todo. Previous gate verdict (8/10 PASS) no longer applies to the current scope.

Current scope: 9 tasks (gathering ceremony only). Relay primitive and 1:1 wiring moved to `session-relay` dependency.

Awaiting fresh gate validation.

- Child sessions get their slug inserted after the agent slash thinking mode and before the title. Those should just be their normal highlight color, no bold, no italicized, just their highlight color. That's all no background coloring, none of that. Now when there is a highlight going over it, that should just be the inverse. We just apply this same routine, right? No special handling, just look at it, be smart about it, don't listen to what I say. When there is a highlight color in that row and there's a highlight applied, it should of course result in the text color being inverted. So that is one of my grievances. Secondly, yeah, this is all related to that because now there is no highlight working on it, even there is no inversion inversion of color happening. It is just ignoring it altogether when there's a highlight. It's just so stupid. Doesn't do anything with it. Ridiculous.

- The SIG user one or SIG user two that reloads the dark light toggle is not taking care of the background color of the TUE pane. When I switch to activate the preview pane, the color of the Tui is correct, but then when I switch back activating the Tue pane, that still incorrectly shows the light background color when I just switch to dark mode.

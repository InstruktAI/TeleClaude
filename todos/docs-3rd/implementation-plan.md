# Implementation Plan: 3rd‑Party Docs Research and Index

## Phase 1: Structure

- [x] Create `docs/3rd/` folder.
- [x] Add `docs/3rd/index.md` with a simple, sortable list of docs.

## Phase 2: Research workflow

- [x] Add a skill or command that:
  - Takes a short research brief
  - Fetches authoritative sources
  - Produces a concise markdown doc in `docs/3rd/`
  - Updates `docs/3rd/index.md`

## Phase 3: Output conventions

- [x] Standardize doc headers (title, source, updated date).
- [x] Keep summaries short and focused on actionable facts.

## Phase 4: Validation

- [ ] Run the workflow once end‑to‑end to generate at least one doc.
- [ ] Verify index update and readability.

# Quality Checklist: deployment-versioning

This checklist is the execution projection of `definition-of-done.md` for this todo.

Ownership:

- Build section: Builder updates only this section.
- Review section: Reviewer updates only this section.
- Finalize section: Finalizer updates only this section.

## Build Gates (Builder)

- [x] Requirements implemented according to scope
- [x] Implementation-plan task checkboxes all `[x]`
- [x] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [x] Lint passes (`make lint`)
- [x] No silent deferrals in implementation plan
- [x] Code committed
- [x] Demo validated (`telec todo demo deployment-versioning` exits 0, or exception noted)
- [x] Working tree clean
- [x] Comments/docstrings updated where behavior changed

Manual verification:

- `python -c "from teleclaude import __version__; print(__version__)"` prints `1.0.0`.
- `python -m teleclaude.cli.telec version` prints version/channel/commit format with graceful commit fallback.

# Input: history-search-upgrade

<!-- Brain dump — raw thoughts, ideas, context. Prepare when ready. -->
I want current history.py solution to be upgraded so that we will have her native agent session file a mirror file that is reduced to only the conversation between the agent and the user. So that only the agent output is extracted without tool calls or anything else. Just on every turn the last agent output and the user input. So that it just seems to be a natural conversation. And and those files need to be periodically sync synchronized at night as the source of truth for the history search. 

In order to make this come to fruition, I want you to start a direct conversation with another AI to think about this and to propose a solution.

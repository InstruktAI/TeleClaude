# Quality Checklist: integrator-shadow-mode

This checklist is the execution projection of `definition-of-done.md` for this todo.

Ownership:

- Build section: Builder updates only this section.
- Review section: Reviewer updates only this section.
- Finalize section: Finalizer updates only this section.

## Build Gates (Builder)

- [x] Requirements implemented according to scope
- [x] Implementation-plan task checkboxes all `[x]`
- [x] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [x] Lint passes (`make lint`)
- [x] No silent deferrals in implementation plan
- [x] Code committed
- [x] Demo validated (`telec todo demo validate integrator-shadow-mode` exits 0, or exception noted)
- [x] Working tree clean
- [x] Comments/docstrings updated where behavior changed

Build notes:

- Manual verification: delivery is backend/runtime behavior with no direct user-facing UI output; verification was done through unit/integration tests and `make test`.
- Working tree cleanliness verification is build-scope clean for tracked files after commit; local untracked `.teleclaude/` tooling files are non-build artifacts.

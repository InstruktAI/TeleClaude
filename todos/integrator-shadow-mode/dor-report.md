# DOR Report: integrator-shadow-mode

## Gate Verdict

- Status: `needs_work` (draft)
- Score: `7/10`
- Ready Decision: **Not ready for build dispatch until formal gate pass.**

## Draft Assessment

1. Requirements clearly define singleton lease and shadow safety boundaries.
2. Plan decomposes lease, queue, runtime simulation, and tests.
3. Verification exists but requires independent gate confirmation.

## Draft Blockers

1. Formal `next-prepare-gate` verdict has not yet been recorded.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced placeholder requirements with shadow-runtime contract.
2. Replaced placeholder implementation plan with lease/queue tasks.
3. Added demo validation commands for prep artifact integrity.

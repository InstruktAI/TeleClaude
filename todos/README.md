# TeleClaude TODOs

## Active Work

**[CURRENT_WORK.md](CURRENT_WORK.md)** - Current implementation tasks and roadmap

## Archive

The `archive/` folder contains completed specs and historical planning documents:

- `redis_adapter.md` - Original Redis adapter specification (partially implemented)
- `mcp_server.md` - MCP server design (Telegram bot restriction analysis)
- `refactoring.md` - Functional programming refactoring (completed)
- `testing_refactor.md` - Testing improvements (completed)
- `tests_investigation.md` - Test suite analysis (historical)
- `hardening_action_plan.md` - Production hardening (historical)

These are kept for reference but are not active work items.

## Workflow

1. Check `CURRENT_WORK.md` for active tasks
2. Update status as work progresses
3. When work is complete, archive the file and create a new one for next phase
4. Keep only ONE active work file at a time for clarity

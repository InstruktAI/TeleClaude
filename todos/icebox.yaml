# Parked work items. Promote back to roadmap.yaml when priority changes.

- slug: test-suite-ownership-reset
  description: Freeze non-emergency feature changes and reset test ownership to a
    deterministic one-to-one model (source file to owning unit test) with path-based
    test gating. Introduce prefix-based bug routing with an atomic per-bug loop.
- slug: agent-file-locking-heartbeat
  description: Agent-level file locking to prevent same-file collisions on main with
    deterministic contention behavior. Heartbeat on contention, retry after 3 minutes,
    then halt with precise blocker report if still locked.
- slug: code-context-annotations
  description: Code annotation extraction and doc snippet integration work. Parked
    behind core identity/streaming/web delivery.
- slug: code-context-auditor
  description: Drift-auditing layer for context annotations. Depends on code-context-annotations.
- slug: bidirectional-agent-links
  description: Agent-to-agent chat/link system. Nice-to-have, not on the near-term
    product path.
- slug: github-maintenance-runner
  description: Periodic GitHub bug triage and automated bugfix PR flow in a dedicated
    maintenance worktree.
- slug: tdd-enforcement
  description: Strict TDD enforcement initiative (upfront approved test contract +
    builder/fixer test immutability). Revisit when bandwidth is available for process
    hardening.

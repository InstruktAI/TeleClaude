# Bug:

## Symptom

When I start adding sticky's my layouts my layout changes and I see multiple pains which works beautifully. However, when I then unsticky them, the layout thing is confused. And they also don't all get removed. And there is just a screw up of the whole rendering. So I want you to investigate our logic around that. And fix it. If you can

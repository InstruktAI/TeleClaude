# Deferrals — textual-footer-migration

Generated by orchestrator round-limit closure on 2026-02-24.

## Non-critical follow-up items

1. Resolve redundant Enter hint visibility in `SessionsView` for `ProjectHeader` and `ComputerHeader` when default actions are already visually indicated.
2. Reconcile Preparation todo-row Enter label/behavior clarity and keep a regression assertion for hint/action parity.
3. Continue monitoring `test_extract_modules_regression` runtime stability under full-suite load and tighten timeout policy after stability data is collected.
4. Complete interactive TUI manual verification for footer bolding and per-node hint transitions (not fully observable in non-interactive review environment).

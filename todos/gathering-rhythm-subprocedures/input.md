# Gathering Rhythm Sub-Procedures

Write three doc snippets that specialize the governing gathering procedure for each rhythm:

## Daily

- Opening question: invites tactical sensing ("What needs attention today?")
- Scope: last 24h of activity, current pipeline state, blockers
- Round structure: 1 inhale round, 2 hold rounds, 1 exhale round
- Harvest types: todos, blockers, quick doc fixes

## Weekly

- Opening question: invites pattern sensing ("What patterns are forming?")
- Scope: daily trail entries from the past week, roadmap progress, recurring friction
- Round structure: 1 inhale round, 3 hold rounds, 1 exhale round
- Harvest types: roadmap updates, principle refinements, memory entries

## Monthly

- Opening question: invites directional sensing ("Where are we headed?")
- Scope: weekly trail entries, roadmap trajectory, vision seeds, evolution of the system
- Round structure: 2 inhale rounds, 3 hold rounds, 2 exhale rounds
- Harvest types: vision seeds, principle refinements, roadmap reprioritization, doc amendments

## Deliverables

- `docs/global/general/procedure/gathering-daily.md`
- `docs/global/general/procedure/gathering-weekly.md`
- `docs/global/general/procedure/gathering-monthly.md`
- Each references the governing `gathering.md` procedure
- Round counts are proposals — may adjust after first live gatherings

# Input: public-website-blog

## The Vision

TeleClaude needs a public face. Not a docs site, not a GitHub README — a beautiful,
opinionated website that represents the philosophy, the platform, and the ongoing work.

The website is the statement. The blog is the proof.

## What this is

A public website for InstruktAI / TeleClaude with:

1. **Landing page** — the main entry point. Beautiful, distinctive, representing the
   philosophy of human-AI collaboration. This is the first impression. It must be
   extraordinary. Not a template. Not generic SaaS marketing. Something that reflects
   the breath, attunement, and proprioception that define the platform.

2. **Blog section** — prominently in top navigation, not the landing page itself.
   Blog posts are the ongoing public record of discoveries, conversations, and
   breakthroughs. The long-term goal: deep AI conversations naturally exhale into
   blog posts (session → narrative → publication). For now: manual authoring with
   AI assistance, published through the platform.

3. **Content that tells a story** — not feature lists. Storytelling about what was
   discovered, how human-AI collaboration actually works, what the philosophy means
   in practice. Each post is a window into the working relationship.

## Constraints

- Must be hostable independently (not behind the TeleClaude daemon).
- Should be a modern, performant static or SSR site.
- Technology: to be decided during prepare (Next.js, Astro, or similar).
- Design must be distinctive — no generic templates. The frontend-design skill
  and approach should be leveraged.
- Blog content format: Markdown-based, easy for AI to generate and humans to edit.
- Publication workflow: to be designed (could start simple, evolve toward automated).

## Broader context

This is the first step toward outbound capabilities — the platform speaking to the
world, not just listening. Future work (separate todos) will build on this:

- Automated session-to-blog-post pipeline.
- Social media publishing and campaigning.
- The global registry of federated TeleClaude instances.

## Why now

The platform has reached a point where the work speaks for itself. Agent shorthand,
direct conversation, breath methodology, context engineering — these are innovations
worth sharing. The meetups are starting. A YouTube channel is planned. The website
is the anchor for all of that outreach.

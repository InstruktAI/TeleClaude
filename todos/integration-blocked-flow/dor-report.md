# DOR Report: integration-blocked-flow

## Gate Verdict

- Status: `needs_work` (draft)
- Score: `7/10`
- Ready Decision: **Not ready for build dispatch until formal gate pass.**

## Draft Assessment

1. Blocked-flow behavior is defined as evidence-rich and resumable.
2. Plan covers blocked payload, follow-up linkage, and resume mechanics.
3. Verification exists but requires independent gate confirmation.

## Draft Blockers

1. Formal `next-prepare-gate` verdict has not yet been recorded.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced placeholder requirements with blocked-flow contract.
2. Replaced placeholder implementation plan with executable task decomposition.
3. Added demo validation commands for prep artifact integrity.

# DOR Report: integration-blocked-flow

## Gate Verdict

- Status: `pass`
- Score: `8/10`
- Ready Decision: **Ready for build dispatch.**

## Gate Assessment

1. Blocked outcome evidence contract is concrete and testable.
2. Follow-up linkage and resume mechanics are explicitly scoped.
3. Verification path covers conflict, follow-up idempotency, and resume.
4. Plan-to-requirement mapping is coherent with no contradictions.

## Gate Tightenings Applied

1. Confirmed follow-up linkage preserves slug/branch/sha traceability.
2. Confirmed resume path requires readiness re-check before requeue.

## Open Blockers

1. None.

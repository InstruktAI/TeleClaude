# Demo Plan: animations-full-color

## Medium
CLI / TUI

## Observation
1. Launch the TeleClaude TUI.
2. The user will observe the main banner rendering in full 24-bit HEX colors instead of the legacy 16-color spectrum.
3. Over time, or by triggering banner animations, the user will see smooth gradient glows, a sky-like clouds passing animation, and floating balloons moving up the banner text.
4. The visual fidelity will be noticeably richer without frame stutters.

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Start the TUI
telec

# Inside the TUI, trigger animations (e.g., via periodic triggers or UI interactions)
# Visually confirm the new gradients.
```

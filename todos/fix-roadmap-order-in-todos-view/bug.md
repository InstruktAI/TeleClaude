# Bug:

## Symptom

Right now I am watching in the work preparation view an incorrect order of the project. In the config.yaml those have a certain order. They are the trusted underscore dears property. And that order should be preserved in the three node view for both the sessions and the work preparation pane. Should all follow one unified path of course, so no hacking multiple callsites.

# Breakdown: telegram-routing-contract-hardening

## Decision

No further split required.

## Assessment

1. Scope is single concern (routing + contract semantics).
2. Verification is explicit and bounded.
3. Approach is known from existing adapter/lane code.

## Result

`breakdown.assessed = true`, `breakdown.todos = []`.

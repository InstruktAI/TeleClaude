## Data Caching & Push Architecture

      TUI reads from local cache, remotes push session events. Instant loads, event-driven updates.

## UI Event Queue

- [>] ui-event-queue-per-adapter
  Create per-adapter UI event queues to avoid cross-adapter bleed.

## Test Suite Quality Cleanup

- [>] test-cleanup
      Refactor test suite to verify observable behavior, add docstrings, document system boundaries.

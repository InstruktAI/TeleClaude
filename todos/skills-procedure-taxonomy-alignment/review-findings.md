## Behavior Preservation Verification

Line-by-line comparison of original wrapper Procedure sections against extracted procedure docs:

| Skill                        | Preserved? | Notes                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorming`              | Yes        | All 8 steps, 5 Socratic prompts, 4 anti-patterns present                            |
| `systematic-debugging`       | Yes        | All 4 phases, 5 anti-patterns, core rules preserved. Recovery section added         |
| `next-silent-failure-hunter` | Yes        | All evaluation criteria and hidden-failure patterns preserved                       |
| `tech-stack-docs`            | Yes        | All 5 steps, bulk workflow preserved. `telec sync` step added                       |
| `youtube`                    | Yes        | Core steps preserved. Flag reference delegated to wrapper Inputs (see Important #1) |

No runtime code paths were modified. All changes are in `agents/skills/`, `docs/`, `demos/`, and `todos/`.

## Paradigm-Fit Assessment

1. **Data flow**: Changes follow the established `## Required reads` + `@` reference pattern used by 7 already-migrated skills. Distribution tooling supports this. Pass.
2. **Component reuse**: Procedure docs follow existing snippet schema (frontmatter, required sections). No copy-paste duplication found. Pass.
3. **Pattern consistency**: Wrapper structure (frontmatter → Required reads → Purpose → Scope → Inputs → Outputs → Procedure) matches already-migrated skills. All 6 new index.yaml entries have correct fields. Pass.

## Critical

None.

## Important

### 1. YouTube procedure circular reference to skill wrapper

**File:** `docs/global/general/procedure/youtube-research.md:30`

Step 2 says: "Pass `--mode <mode>` and the mode-specific flags (see Inputs in the skill wrapper)."

This creates a procedure → wrapper back-reference. The taxonomy's Why section states that "the procedure logic is reusable independently of any skill invocation." An agent reading this procedure via `telec docs get` (not through the skill) has no "skill wrapper" to consult.

The flag reference is long and detailed, so duplicating it would increase drift risk. Consider replacing the parenthetical with a self-contained summary (e.g., "flags such as `--query`, `--channels`, `--ids`, `--max-videos`, `--char-cap`") or pointing to `youtube_helper.py --help`.

### 2. Taxonomy concept doc has non-schema H2 section

**File:** `docs/global/general/concept/skill-taxonomy.md:29`

The concept doc has `## What`, `## Why`, then `## Exploratory lane — migration pass 1` with three H3 subsections. Concept docs per the snippet schema should have `## What` and `## Why` (plus optional `## See Also`). The migration roster content (in-scope, excluded, already-migrated) is valuable and satisfies R1, but it lives in a non-standard section.

Consider restructuring: either fold the roster tables into `## What` as subsections (the What section already defines the taxonomy — the roster demonstrates it), or accept this as intentional extension. `telec sync` passed, so the schema enforcement may tolerate this.

## Suggestions

### 3. Worktree paths in generated index.yaml files

`docs/project/index.yaml` and `docs/third-party/index.yaml` contain worktree-specific `project_root` and `snippets_root` paths. These are generated by `telec sync` and will be corrected post-merge. Non-blocking.

### 4. YouTube example label mismatch

`agents/skills/youtube/SKILL.md:98` — Label says "Combine query + channel filter:" but the command only uses `--channel "ThePrimeagen"` without `--query`. Either add a `--query` flag or change the label.

### 5. Context7 reference without explanation

`docs/global/software-development/procedure/research/tech-stack-documentation.md:33` — Step 2 mentions "Context7" without context. A standalone procedure reader may not know what Context7 is. Consider a brief parenthetical like "Context7 (MCP documentation tool)".

### 6. See Also paths use filesystem paths, not snippet IDs

`docs/global/general/concept/skill-taxonomy.md:59-60` — See Also references `~/.teleclaude/docs/...` paths. Check if the project convention for See Also prefers snippet IDs (e.g., `general/principle/breath`).

## Why No Issues at Critical Level

1. **Paradigm-fit verified**: All wrapper and procedure structures follow established patterns. No copy-paste duplication — each procedure doc was extracted from its corresponding wrapper, not cloned.
2. **Requirements fully met**: All 6 requirements traced to concrete implementation evidence. Taxonomy exists, procedures exist, wrappers reference them, validation passes.
3. **Behavior preservation confirmed**: Every step, anti-pattern, and constraint from the original wrappers appears in the extracted procedure docs. No operational logic was lost.
4. **No runtime impact**: Zero `teleclaude/` code paths touched. This is a docs/skills-only migration.

## Verdict: APPROVE

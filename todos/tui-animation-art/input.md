# tui-animation-art

Retro-gaming visual experience for the TUI. Banner scroll-out/in motion, depth-layered effects (behind active tab, in front of inactive), three-mode animation toggle (off / periodic / party). Commodore 64 demoscene + Mario Kart aesthetic. Creative-first process: art director + art creator brainstorm visual concepts before builders implement. Extends existing banner animation system.

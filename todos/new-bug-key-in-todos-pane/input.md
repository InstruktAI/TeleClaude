# Input: new-bug-key-in-todos-pane

<!-- Brain dump — raw thoughts, ideas, context. Prepare when ready. -->

It should be possible to have a new submenu key with the small letter B that will create a new to do but instead we'll focus on the bug.md file in the to do. Right now it launches in the input.md file. But for a new bug we also we instead of input.md we expect it to have a bug.md file only we have the TLek bugs report sub command now and I want you to follow what it does because Talek to do create creates a to do with input.md I think we should have Talek bugs create which will just create the skeleton with the bug.md f file in it instead and that can then be used when I press that button to start a new bug

## Think‑Only Mode

If the user asks for thinking, reasoning, architecture, analysis, or planning (even implicitly), enter think‑only / planning mode: no edits, no commands, no code output.

Examples: “think with me”, “just think”, “reason about this”, “architecture/architect mode”, “evaluate options”, “brainstorm”, “diagnose”, “analyze root cause”, “design a plan”, “walk me through”.

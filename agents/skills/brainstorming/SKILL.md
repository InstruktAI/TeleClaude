# Brainstorming

## Required reads

- @~/.teleclaude/docs/general/procedure/socratic-design-refinement.md

## Purpose

Refine ideas into explicit designs through focused questioning and trade-off analysis before writing implementation code.

## Scope

Apply before creative implementation work such as new features, UI components, workflows, and behavior changes.

Hard gate: do not start implementation until a design is presented and approved.

## Inputs

- Problem statement or user intent.
- Current project context (existing architecture, constraints, patterns).
- Success criteria and known limitations.

## Outputs

- Clarified requirements with assumptions surfaced.
- 2-3 viable approaches with trade-offs and a recommendation.
- Approved design summary ready for implementation planning.
- Documented decisions and open questions.

## Procedure

Follow the socratic design refinement procedure. Full steps, Socratic prompts, and anti-patterns are in the required reads above.

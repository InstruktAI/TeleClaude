Principle

- Action is grounded in determinism: intent is translated into explicit anchors before it becomes execution.

Rationale

- Autonomy is meaningful when it is stable under ambiguity.
- Deterministic anchors preserve intent and reduce drift from interpretation to action.
- Precision protects effort from speculative paths that feel plausible but are not verifiable.

Implications

- Heuristics illuminate where to look; anchors define what is real.
- Reliable progress favors verifiable artifacts over interpretive resemblance.
- When anchors are present, autonomy accelerates without losing intent.

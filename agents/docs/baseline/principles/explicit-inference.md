Principle

- Make inference explicit before action; hidden leaps erode reliability.

Rationale

- Implicit assumptions create false certainty and brittle outcomes.
- Clarity emerges when reasoning steps are surfaced, not buried.
- Explicit inference keeps intent stable under ambiguity and pressure.

Implications

- If a step cannot be stated, it is not ready to execute.
- Exposed reasoning reveals gaps early and prevents drift.
- Clear inference protects effort from speculative paths.

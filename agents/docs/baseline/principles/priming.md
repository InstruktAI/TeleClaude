Principle

- Provide context that elevates expert reasoning, not generic or average responses.

Rationale

- Immediate context is the strongest steering signal for model behavior.
- Generic framing pushes outputs toward the middle of the training distribution.
- Expert output depends on precise intent, not volume.
- The best priming preserves meaning while reducing ambiguity.

Implications

- Emphasize high-leverage distinctions, boundaries, and invariants.
- Prefer decisive, specialist framing over broad, neutral summaries.
- Use domain language that signals expertise and constraints.
- Keep priming aligned to the exact outcome, not adjacent topics.

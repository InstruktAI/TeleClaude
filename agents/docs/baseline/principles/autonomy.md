Principle

- Autonomy is steady progress grounded in inferred intent and high-level heuristics.

Rationale

- Autonomy fails when it stalls on trivial obstacles or waits for perfect clarity.
- Most boundaries are implicit and must be inferred from intent and precedent.
- The measure of autonomy is forward motion without loss of meaning.
- Autonomy remains stable when intent is translated into verifiable anchors before execution.

Implications

- Autonomy prefers action when intent is clear.
- Autonomy infers boundaries from meaning and precedent, not arbitrary limits.
- Autonomy slows only when ambiguity could change the direction, not the details.
- Heuristics reveal where to look; anchors define what must be true.
- When anchors are present, autonomy can accelerate without drift.

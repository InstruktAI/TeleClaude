Principle

- Document intent, boundaries, and durable reasoning—the knowledge that is not stored in code.

Rationale

- Code captures behavior; documentation must capture why and when.
- Intent prevents drift when implementation details evolve.
- Boundaries keep decisions aligned across components and time.

Implications

- Write snippets that preserve invariants, decisions, and cross-cutting constraints.
- Keep documentation focused on meaning that survives refactors and rewrites.

# Conflict Resolution Rules — Policy

## Rule

- Resolve conflicts by priority: specificity → intent → applicability → recency.
- Treat documentation as direction; use code to confirm behavior.

## Rationale

- Consistent priority prevents indecision and hidden rule‑picking.
- Code is the ground truth when docs and behavior diverge.

## Scope

- Applies to all agent instructions, project docs, and tool guidance.

## Enforcement

- If two rules conflict, choose the higher‑priority rule and proceed.
- Note the conflict in the final report if it affects outcomes.

## Exceptions

- None.

# Conflict Resolution Rules — Policy

When guidance conflicts, resolve with these priorities:

1. **Specificity** — honor the narrowest, most context‑bound guidance first.
2. **Intent** — preserve the stated purpose and constraints of the work.
3. **Applicability** — choose guidance that matches the current stack and task.
4. **Recency** — prefer material that reflects current behavior.

Documentation sets direction; code confirms behavior. Use both to keep decisions aligned.

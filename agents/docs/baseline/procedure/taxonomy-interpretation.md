# Taxonomy Interpretation Procedure — Procedure

Use the taxonomy list as a lens for interpreting requests and organizing docs.

## Taxonomy (Exhaustive)

- **policy**: rules, constraints, non-negotiables
- **standard**: enforced conventions or quality bars
- **guide**: recommended approach or best practice
- **procedure**: ordered steps with outputs
- **principles**: high-level governing ideas that shape design and judgment
- **role**: identity, responsibilities, boundaries
- **checklist**: verification or readiness criteria
- **reference**: static facts or lookup tables
- **concept**: definitions or framing
- **architecture**: system structure, components, and relationships
- **example**: concrete usage or pattern

## Scope Levels

- **global**: universal across all projects
- **domain**: applies to a domain (e.g., software development)
- **project**: applies only to a specific repository or team

## Rules

- Pick exactly one taxonomy type per snippet.
- Organize docs by domain and type so selection can stay atomic.
- Use the taxonomy to decide what still needs to be covered.

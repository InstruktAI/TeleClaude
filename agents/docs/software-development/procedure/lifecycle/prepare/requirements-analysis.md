# Prepare: Requirements Analysis — Procedure

## When requirements.md Exists

- Confirm the document is complete, unambiguous, and testable.
- Verify constraints and success criteria are explicit.
- Identify any gaps that would block implementation planning.

## When requirements.md Is Missing

Analyze and report:

- Problem statement and intended outcomes.
- Derived requirements from existing context.
- Ambiguities that change scope or design decisions.
- Constraints that must hold throughout implementation.
